UDOIT will scan your course content, generate a report and provide instructions on how to correct accessibility issues. Funding for UDOIT was provided by a Canvas Grant awarded in 2014.\n\nPlease Note: This tool is meant to be used as a guide, not a certification. It only checks for common accessibility issues, and is not comprehensive; a clean report in UDOIT does not necessarily mean that your course is fully accessible. Likewise, the tool may indicate a possible accessibility issue where one does not exist.",
