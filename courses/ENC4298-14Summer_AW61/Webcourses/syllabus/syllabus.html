They learn how to form a virtual team and structure a team project to be carried out without any face-to-face team meetings. They will evaluate the tasks that need to be performed and will select the most appropriate tools to use for those tasks. They will meet the challenges inherent in virtual teamwork and develop strategies for overcoming those challenges. They will also develop methods for tracking and evaluating their collaborative work. Students will work on a major project and also produce several short documents.</p>

<p><strong>Incomplete Grade Policy: </strong>Incompletes will be given only at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Course Policies:</h2>
<p>These course policies relate to issues of course participation, extra credit, late assignments, plagiarism, academic dishonesty, disability accommodation, standards for written work, and <cite class="normal">the Gordon Rule</cite>.</p>
<h3>Class Participation:</h3>
<p>In an online course, attendance as such is not an issue. However, students are expected to stay current with the required readings and other assignments. Students are also expected to participate in all meetings held by their teams throughout the semester.</p>
<h3>Make-up Work/Extra Credit:</h3>
<p>As a rule, I do not give make-up assignments or extra credit. Plan to do the necessary work to succeed on your assignments, rather than relying on special assignments to improve your grade.</p>
<h3>Late Assignments:</h3>
<p>Late assignments will not receive full credit. To receive full credit, an assignment must be turned in on time <strong>and </strong>must be complete. For example, the Project Proposal assignment will not be counted as complete unless a schedule chart is attached.</p>
<h3>Plagiarism, Cheating, and Academic Dishonesty:</h3>
<p>All work that you submit for this class must be your own, and it must be written exclusively for this course. Also, any sources consulted for your writing must be properly documented. &ldquo;Rewriting,&rdquo; in which a student consults a source, changes a few words, and presents the ideas as his/her own, is plagiarism. Plagiarism and cheating of any kind on an examination, quiz, or assignment will result at least in an &ldquo;F&rdquo; for that assignment and may also lead to an &ldquo;F&rdquo; for the entire course. Plagiarism and cheating subjects a student to referral to the Office of Student Conduct for further action. See the UCF Golden Rule for further information (http://www.goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). I will assume for this course that you will adhere to the academic creed of this University and will maintain the highest standards of academic integrity. In other words, do not cheat by giving answers to others or by taking them from anyone else. I will also adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity, so please do not expect me to change your grade illegitimately or to bend or break rules for one person that will not apply to everyone.</p>
<h3>Disability Accommodation:</h3>
<p>The University of Central Florida is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need accommodations in this course must contact the professor at the beginning of the semester to discuss needed accommodations. No accommodations will be provided until the student has met with the professor to request accommodations. Students who need accommodations must be registered with Student Disability Services, Student Resource Center Room 132, phone (407) 823-2371, TTY/TDD only phone (407) 823-2116, before requesting accommodations from the professor.</p>
<h3>Syllabus Amendment:</h3>
<p>This syllabus may be amended or modified in any way upon notice; most such changes will affect the Course Schedule, so be sure that you know if any due dates change.</p>
<h3>University Writing Center:</h3>
<p>The University Writing Center (UWC) is a free resource for UCF undergraduate and graduate students. The UWC's most popular service is the individualized writing consultation: a trained writing consultant will spend thirty minutes with you reviewing your work and making recommendations for revision. The consultant will work with you for an hour if your paper is longer than seven pages or if you are writing a paper with a group. (Under these circumstances, all group members should attend the session.) You can bring your work to the UWC at any point in the process--even if you have not yet started writing. Your consultation will be most helpful if you take the time to:</p>
<dl class="normal"><dt><strong>prepare: </strong></dt><dd>identify specific issues on which you want feedback</dd><dt><strong>participate:</strong></dt><dd>actively discuss your paper with the consultant</dd><dt><strong>reflect:</strong></dt><dd>decide which of the possibilities raised during the consultation will help you</dd><dt><strong>act: </strong></dt><dd>revise your paper</dd></dl>
<p>The UWC will help with writing in any subject, including out-of-class writing such as job application letters. The UWC will also help you organize oral presentations. After each consultation, you will receive a Record of Consultation (RoC) form that summarizes what was discussed. It is best to make an appointment; however, the UWC does accept walk-ins. You may use the UWC computers to work on your writing without an appointment; available software includes Microsoft Office 2000, and specialized software (Editor, Writer's Helper, Minklink, Inspiration) for brainstorming, organizing, problem-solving, proofreading, and editing. The UWC does not write, proofread, or grade papers. For more information or to make an appointment, visit the UWC website at <a href="http://www.uwc.ucf.edu/">http://www.uwc.ucf.edu</a>, stop by MOD 608, or call 407-823-2197.</p>
<h3>Standards for Written Work:</h3>
<p>An &ldquo;A&rdquo; text is exceptional. This kind of document might lead to a promotion in the workplace. It is professional and reflects the writer's careful consideration of audience and purpose. It contains all necessary information (invention), is written in an appropriate and engaging style, is arranged in a logical manner, is memorable, and its delivery is visually appealing. It is free of mechanical errors.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;B&rdquo; text is strong. It would be considered acceptable in the workplace. It too is <br /> professional and reflects consideration of the rhetorical situation. It is generally above average in terms of the criteria mentioned for the &ldquo;A&rdquo; text, but falls short of excellence in one or more category. It is free of mechanical errors.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;C&rdquo; text is competent. It would probably be returned for revision in the <br /> workplace. It is generally average in terms of the major criteria listed for the &ldquo;A&rdquo; text. It has few mechanical errors.</p>
<p>Low &ldquo;C&rdquo; or &ldquo;D&rdquo; work is weak. It would probably get the writer into a difficult situation in the workplace. It falls below average in terms of one or more of the major criteria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F&rdquo; work fails in terms of one or more of these criteria. One or more of these texts would probably get a writer fired in the workplace.</p>
<h3><cite class="normal">Gordon Rule</cite>:</h3>
<p>All courses with AML, ENC, ENG, ENL, and LIT prefixes adhere to the <cite class="normal">Gordon Rule</cite>. Historically, the Gordon Rule mandated that these courses include 6000 words of graded written work; the revised <cite class="normal">Gordon Rule</cite> necessitates that they include four written and graded assignments. At the same time, the English Department tries to maintain smaller class sizes than many of our peer departments in CAH (e.g., History, Philosophy) because our courses are writing-intensive. So, it is departmental policy that we adhere to the 6000-word requirement of evaluated writing, 4000 words of which must be analytical, interpretative, and/or researched prose.</p>
