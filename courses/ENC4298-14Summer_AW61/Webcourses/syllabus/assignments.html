<h2 class="bullet">Project Proposal (25 points) Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday, 5/21</h2>
<p>In the Proposal you should discuss the technologies that your team plans to evaluate in the Research Report. Your Proposal should discuss the structure and management of your team; you should designate a team leader and any other roles that team members will play. Your Proposal should include a description of your contingency plans. You should also include your schedule and your plans for reviewing and editing your Report.</p>
<p>Your Proposal should be a response to the Request for Proposal (RFP) that follows <strong>and </strong>should use the format of the RFP as a model for the format of your Proposal.</p>
<dl class="normal"><dt><strong>To:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Students in ENC 4298</strong></dt><dt><strong>From:&nbsp; </strong><strong>Dr. Flammia</strong></dt><dt><strong>Re:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Request for Proposal (RFP) for Research Report</strong></dt><dt><strong>Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; May 12, 2014</strong><strong></strong></dt></dl>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to request that each team submit a detailed and specific proposal describing all aspects of the team&rsquo;s plans for completing the Research Report.</p>
<p>The proposal should convince Dr. Flammia that your team has a well-developed and carefully designed management plan, a realistic schedule, appropriate tools, and strategies for addressing the challenges related to virtual collaboration.</p>
<p>Your proposal must include these sections: Introduction, Description of Report Content, Team Structure and Management Plan, Contingency Plans, Schedule (including a Gantt chart), Collaborative Tools, Review and Evaluation Plans, and Conclusion. Each section should include detailed information, and may include attachments, if necessary. Every proposal must include a Gantt chart as an attachment to the Schedule section.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The introduction is the only section that does not require a heading. The introduction should be a brief statement of the purpose of the proposal; the purpose is to request approval of your plans for carrying out the virtual team project. The introduction should also include a <strong>brief</strong> statement describing the technologies that you plan to research. The next section, Description of Report Content, will contain your detailed description of the technologies your team plans to analyze.</p>
<h3>Description of Report Content</h3>
<p>Give an overview of each of the technologies that your team plans to research, test, and analyze. Remember that your team should analyze one technology per team member; therefore, a team with five members should research five separate and distinct technologies. Be sure to explain why each technology is appropriate for inclusion in a report on tools for virtual collaboration.</p>
<h3>Team Structure and Management Plan</h3>
<p>In this section you should describe the division of labor within your team, specifically stating which responsibilities each team member will have. You should indicate which team member(s) is going to serve as the team leader and designate any other roles that team members will fulfill (editor, troubleshooter, technical support person). You are only required to designate a team leader, the other roles are optional. You should clearly delineate the responsibilities associated with each position. Be sure to mention specific actions and duties. For example, do not merely say, the team leader will communicate with the team. Instead say, the team leader will send email reminders to all team members before each meeting.&nbsp; You should also specify which technology each team member is responsible for researching.</p>
<h3>Contingency Plans</h3>
<p>Chapter 4 in our textbook discusses communication among team members and offers suggestions for improving communication within a virtual team. Chapter 6 focuses on some of the challenges that may arise during the course of a virtual collaboration. Virtual teams may face challenges related to technology, time, and interpersonal communication. This section of the proposal should detail your plans for maintaining strong communication, preventing and/or resolving conflict, and addressing technical problems.</p>
<p>You should have a plan in place for dealing with time lost due to technical problems or other unavoidable delays. You should discuss in precise detail your process for resolving conflict among team members and for addressing the issue of non-participating team members. Having well-developed contingency plans can be the deciding factor in the success of your collaboration.</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>Your schedule should reflect careful planning for all aspects of your project: researching, drafting, designing, reviewing, and editing your Research Report. You should include milestones, dates by which certain key stages of your project will be completed. Include <strong>both</strong> a brief prose summary of your schedule and milestones and a Gantt chart which shows the various activities you will perform over time.</p>
<p>Attach your Gantt chart in an appendix to your document and be sure to refer to its location in the text under the <strong>Schedule</strong> heading. Remember that your purpose in this section is to persuade your reader that you have planned well, that you have allotted adequate time for each phase of the project, and that you can meet your deadlines.</p>
<p>Your schedule should include all team meetings (you must have at least one meeting per week) and all deliverables associated with the project (progress report, peer review).</p>
<h3>Collaborative Tools</h3>
<p>This section should describe in detail all the tools you will use for collaboration. You may include the technologies that you are researching in this section; however, you do not need to describe them in detail again. You should describe any other technologies you will use in addition to those technologies you are researching. Be sure to explain how you will use each tool. Any technologies that you choose to use must be available to all members of the team.</p>
<h3>Review and Editing Plans</h3>
<p>The purpose of this section is to describe your review process. In other words, how you plan to seek feedback on your work from reviewers outside your team and how you plan to review the work of your teammates. You should plan to conduct at least two reviews of your document in addition to the required peer review assignment. You should review the first draft once each team member has completed his or her section of the document. Then you should review the document a second time after the Introduction and Conclusion and all required sections have been added. During this second review, you should strive to make sure that the document has a consistent tone and writing style.</p>
<p>After the second review, you should also carefully edit the document for both writing style and format. You will want to be sure that the writing style is correct and consistent. You should also check that the format adheres to the guidelines given in the Research Report Template.</p>
<p>You may choose to designate one team member as the editor, but all team members must participate in reviewing the document.</p>
<p>All your review and editing plans should be clearly stated in this section of the proposal, including the dates when reviews will occur and the individuals who will take part in the reviews in addition to your team members.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Your conclusion should be brief. Restate your commitment to and enthusiasm for the project. Use the conclusion as an opportunity to create one final positive impression in the reader&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<h3>Final Points</h3>
<p>Your proposal is a serious, professional document. Just as a resume is often the sole document that represents an individual, your proposal must stand alone to represent your team. Be sure that your proposal is clearly written and well organized. Put it in the memo format and use headings and adequate white space to make it attractive and readable. Proofread your proposal carefully, and make sure that it is error free.</p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Progress Report (10 points) Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday, 6/4</h2>
<p>Your progress report should be in memo format addressed to Dr. Flammia. The progress report should cover three major topics: Progress to Date, Anticipated Progress, and Problems/Solutions. Be sure to specify dates for the time period covered by the Progress to Date and Anticipated Progress sections.</p>
<p>In the Problems/Solutions section you should detail any unexpected changes to the project, any challenges you encountered, and anything else relevant to the project and its current status not covered in the first two sections of the report. A good progress report will not merely state a problem, but will go on to discuss how you solved it or how you plan to solve it.</p>
<p>The progress report should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs with headings to organize the content. You should not use lists or tables in the report. Do not include a schedule chart within the report. If you feel it is necessary to include a schedule, it should be an attachment to the report.</p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Peer Review Assignment (10 points) Draft Posted by 11:59 pm Monday, 6/9; Peer Review Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday, 6/11</h2>
<p>The Peer Review assignment has two parts (each part is worth 5 points):</p>
<ol class="paddedlist">
<li>Post a draft of your team's manual for peer review no later than 11:59 pm on Monday, 6/9.</li>
<li>Complete a review of the work of your peer review partners no later than 11:59 pm on Wednesday, 6/11.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bullet">Research Report (25 points) Due by 11:59 pm Thursday, 6/19</h2>
<h3>Description of Project</h3>
<p>The team project is a Research Report on collaborative technologies (including blogs, wikis, podcasts, and chat tools). Each team member will be responsible for selecting a different technology and proposing it to the team for inclusion in the Report. Then the team will use each of the technologies selected to test its effectiveness for collaborative work. Finally, each team member will be responsible for writing an analysis of one of the technologies.</p>
<p>The analysis should cover a discussion/description of the advantages and disadvantages of using each technology for communication and collaborative work. The analysis of each technology should include references to journal articles, white papers, and textbooks, as well as the team&rsquo;s experiences with the technologies.</p>
<p>The Research Report will include an analysis of one technology per team member. The entire team must review and approve each member&rsquo;s individual analysis. In addition to the individual analyses, the Report should include a brief introduction and a conclusion that draws together the main points of the Report and makes recommendations for how these technologies could be used for virtual team collaboration specifically, and for team work in general.</p>
<p>The format of the Research Report should be based on the Research Report Template available under the Materials Button on the Course Home Page.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<p>The Research Report will be evaluated based on its content, format, and writing style.</p>
<h4>Fifteen points will be awarded for the content.</h4>
<p>The content should include a thorough discussion of each tool evaluated by the team. The coverage of the tools should be consistent; that is to say, each tool should be discussed in approximately the same depth and include a well-developed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of using each technology for communication and collaborative work. Further the analyses should include references to journal articles, white papers, and textbooks, as well as the team members&rsquo; own experiences with the technologies.</p>
<h4>Ten points will be awarded for the presentation of the information (format and writing style).</h4>
<p>The content of the Report should be well organized with a clear hierarchy of information. The Report should follow the template for the assignment. The writers should strive to integrate their separate research into a Report that has a unified voice. The writing style should be consistent. The references should be presented using the MLA style for referencing sources. The references section must be accurate and complete.</p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Individual Memo (20 points) Due by 11:59 pm Thursday, 6/19</h2>
<p>Your Individual Memo should be in memo format addressed to Dr. Flammia. You should begin the memo with a very brief description of the technologies that your team researched. Then you should go on to discuss these topics:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Your specific contributions to the team</li>
<li>A description any roles that you took on in your team (leader, troubleshooter, peace maker, and so on)</li>
<li>Your impressions of working in a virtual team (including whether or not you would wish to do so again)</li>
<li>Any problems you encountered and how you handled them</li>
<li>The most valuable things you learned from doing the project</li>
<li>New skills you developed during the course of the project</li>
<li>The way this project has improved your project management skills</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to use headings to organize your memo. You should discuss each topic in detail. Your memo should be two to three single-spaced pages in length. It should not be longer than three single-spaced pages.</p>
<p>Then, include a separate page (in addition to the required 2-3 page limit) with the answers to these questions on team leadership. The purpose of these questions is not to evaluate individual students who served as team leaders, but rather to study different team leadership structures and their effectiveness.</p>
<p>What was your team's leadership structure? One leader, two leaders, rotating leadership, other?</p>
<p>How satisfied were you with your team leader(s). Be as specific as possible about the team's structure, functioning, and success. Try to avoid focusing on personality issues.</p>
<p>If you were a team leader, how would you evaluate your effectiveness as a leader. Are there things you will do differently the next time you lead a team?</p>
<p>Would you want to be in a team with the same leadership structure again? Explain why or why not.</p>
<p>Were there team members who were not designated as leaders who took on a leadership role? Did their actions help the team succeed? Explain why or why not.</p>
