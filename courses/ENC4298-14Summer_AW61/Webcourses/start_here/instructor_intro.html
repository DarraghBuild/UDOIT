<h1>Instructor Introduction</h1>
<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>Welcome to ENC 4298. I know that we are going to have a great semester!</p>
<p>Here are some important reminders:</p>
<ol class="paddedlist">
<li>You should print out the Course Schedule located on the Course Home and refer to it for the due dates for all assignments. It is your responsibility to keep track of the Schedule.</li>
<li>There are a total of twelve course modules. You should complete two modules per week during our six-week semester. Begin with Modules 1 &amp; 2 this week.</li>
<li>Post your Introduction Message in the Introduction Message topic under Discussions.</li>
<li>Check your email every day. I will frequently send important reminders to you via Course Mail. Always use Course Mail to contact me.</li>
<li>There are two assignments due this week: the Introduction Message and the Team Selection.</li>
<li>Remember that the Introduction Message, due on Wednesday, is a formal message to me, Dr. Flammia. Be sure that you write in a formal manner. Use complete sentences and paragraphs. Do not use slang or informal language. Proofread your message before posting it. To earn full credit be sure that you write a thorough and thoughtful response.</li>
<li>Most importantly, please feel free to contact me at any time with any questions you may have. I am always happy to help you, but I will have no way of knowing that you have a question unless you ask me.</li>
</ol>
<p>The semester will go by very quickly, so be sure to let me know RIGHT AWAY if you need my help or run into any problems.</p>
<p>Once again, welcome to ENC 4298. I look forward to our semester together.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Dr. Flammia</p>
