            <h2 class="bullet">The Importance of the Proposal for the Research Report</h2>
            <p>The Proposal that you develop for your Research Report can serve as a valuable planning document for your project. You should be sure that you put as much detailed and specific information as possible into your Proposal. As you work on your Research Report throughout the semester, your Proposal can be a source of guidance regarding what needs to be done when. It can serve as an informal contract among team members regarding the roles and responsibilities they will each fulfill. The Proposal can provide guidelines for dealing with any challenges that may arise during the course of the project. Do not underestimate the value of a well-developed Proposal to the success of your virtual team collaboration. A thorough and well-written Proposal may prevent misunderstanding and save time during crucial periods in the semester.</p>
            <p>Be sure to proofread your Proposal carefully before turning it in. Then, once you have turned in the Proposal assignment, you should begin the research phase of your project. Do not waste time. Begin researching as soon as the Proposal is complete.</p>

            <p><strong>Meeting Minutes (10 points) Due by 11:59 pm Friday, 9/21</strong></p>
            <p>NOTE: Each team member is responsible for one set of meeting minutes and will graded for them individually.</p>
            <p>The meeting minutes should be concise (not longer than two pages). They should follow the format of the sample minutes on page 94 in Chapter 4 of our textbook. They must indicate who led the meeting and who attended. Any absences must be noted. The minutes should indicate the technology used and the date and time of the meeting. They should also indicate the duration of the meeting (1 hr 14 min). Finally, the body of the minutes should briefly note key outcomes of the meeting. Any action items should clearly indicate which team member(s) are responsible for those actions. For example: Contact Dr. Flammia with questions (Team Leader).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:  You only need to submit the minutes for one of your team's meetings for each due date, although your team may have more than one meeting per week.</strong></p>
