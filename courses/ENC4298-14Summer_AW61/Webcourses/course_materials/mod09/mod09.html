<h2 class="bullet">The Drafting Phase</h2>
<p>This week you should continue developing the draft of your Research Report. Be sure to use the style guidelines that you developed last week to guide your writing and revision of the content. At this point you should begin drafting the Introduction and Conclusion sections of your Research Report. You should also begin to think about the front and back matter of your Report. Front matter is any section of a report that comes before the main body of the report, and back matter is any section of the Report that comes after the main body. For your Research Report, you will include these sections as front matter:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Title page</li>
<li>Summary</li>
<li>Acknowledgements</li>
<li>Table of Contents</li>
<li>List of Figures (if needed)</li>
<li>List of Tables (if needed)</li>
<li>Glossary (if needed)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will include these sections as back matter:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>References</li>
<li>Appendices</li>
</ul>
<p>The main body of your Research Report will consist of these sections:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Main Report Sections</li>
<li>Conclusion and Recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more thorough description of the format of the Research Report assignment, you should refer to the Research Report Template available under the Materials Button on the Course Home Page.</p>
<p>Your team should have already divided up the responsibility for creating the Introduction, Conclusion, and the front and back matter. You should also be sure that all team members review each of these sections once they have been drafted.</p>

<h2 class="bullet">ASSIGNMENTS DUE THIS WEEK:</h2>
<p><strong>Progress Report (10 points) Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday, 6/4&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Your progress report should be in memo format addressed to Dr. Flammia. The progress report should cover three major topics: Progress to Date, Anticipated Progress, and Problems/Solutions. Be sure to specify dates for the Progress to Date and Anticipated Progress sections.</p>
<p>In the Problems/Solutions section you should detail any unexpected changes to the project, any challenges you encountered, and anything else relevant to the project and its current status not covered in the first two sections of the report. A good progress report will not merely state a problem, but will go on to discuss how you solved it or how you plan to solve it.</p>
<p>The progress report should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs with headings to organize the content. You should not use lists or tables in the report. Do not include a schedule chart within the report. If you feel it is necessary to include a schedule, it should be an attachment to the report.</p>
