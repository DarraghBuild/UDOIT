<h2 class="bullet">The Drafting Phase</h2>
<p>Once your team has gathered all the necessary information through research and testing, you are ready to begin drafting your Research Report. It is important to get started and put words on paper, even if you may have to revise them later. Remember that the Research Report will include an analysis of one technology per team member. If your team has five members, then you should analyze five technologies.</p>
<p>The analysis should cover a discussion/description of the advantages and disadvantages of using each technology for communication and collaborative work. The analysis of each technology should include references to journal articles, white papers, and textbooks, as well as the team's experiences with the technologies.</p>
<p>Do not be concerned about the Introduction, Conclusion, and other components of the Report at this time. Your team should focus on developing the body of the Report which will consist of a thorough and well-researched analysis of one technology per team member.</p>
<h2>Internal Reviews and Writing Style</h2>
<p>Once each team member has completed his/her draft, the entire team must review and approve each member's individual analysis. Each team member should read all the other team members' drafts. When you review each other's drafts, pay attention to the writing style each team member uses. One of the challenges of developing a document with a team is striving to create a unified writing style. Your team will need to determine the elements of your group style so that the final version of your Research Report has a cohesive style. In some cases, a team may choose one member to serve as an editor to create a unified style after the document is completed. However, you will find it easier to produce the final version of your Report if you begin setting down some style guidelines after your first set of internal reviews (that is, after all team members have read one another's first drafts).</p>
<p>As you know, many corporations have style guides to help employees develop documents that are consistent. After you have reviewed the first draft of your Research Report, you may wish to develop a brief style guide or style sheet to make sure that the various sections of your Report are consistent. Your guidelines may include advice on these issues:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Use "we" rather than "I" throughout the document.</li>
<li>Avoid passive voice.</li>
<li>Vary sentence length and avoid overly long or short sentences.</li>
<li>Use terminology consistently and define terms the first time they appear.</li>
<li>Use abbreviations consistently and always spell them out the first time they appear. For example, you would write: Society for Technical Communication (STC).</li>
</ul>
<p>These guidelines are just suggestions to get you thinking about the types of style issues that you may want to address. Your team may come up with other guidelines based on the issues that you find when reviewing your first draft.</p>
<p>Remember that the format of the Research Report should be based on the Research Report Template available under the Materials Button on the Course Home Page.</p>
