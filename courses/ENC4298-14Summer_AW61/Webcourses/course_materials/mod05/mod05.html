<h2 class="bullet">Managing Conflict and Maintaining a Harmonious Team Culture</h2>
<p>As stated in Chapter 6 in our textbook, most conflicts within teams are "minor clashes of work styles, personality differences, or cultural misunderstanding." Open communication and a respectful attitude are the best means for approaching any disagreements that may arise within your team. You may determine that it is the job of your team leader to step in and help resolve any conflicts that arise, or you may designate a team member to serve as a mediator or peacemaker. Either way, it is important that conflicts are dealt with openly and in a timely manner. Failure to address conflicts within a team can lead to a breakdown in communication among team members. It is best to address any conflicts that arise right away.</p>
<p>Before any conflicts come up, in addition to designating the team leader or another team member as the mediator you may also wish to determine which tools you will use for communicating when seeking to resolve a disagreement. However, the best way to deal with conflicts is to prevent them by maintaining a strong team culture. If all team members establish positive habits of communication and maintain a respectful attitude even when expressing differing viewpoints, unwanted conflict may be averted. Be sure to review the suggestions for getting along with people presented on page 135 in Chapter 6 of our textbook.</p>
<h2>Strategies for Managing Risk and Change</h2>
<p>Chapter 8 in our textbook offers some useful guidelines for managing risk and change during the course of a project. Although you may not encounter the types of changes discussed in our textbook, as you work on your Research Report throughout the semester it is possible that unanticipated changes will occur. For example, one team member may drop out of the course. Or you may determine that there is not sufficient information on one of the technologies that you planned to research.</p>
<p>The best way to handle any unexpected changes or risk factors affecting your project is to address them as soon as they occur. You may wish to devote a section of one of your weekly team meetings to addressing changes and/or risk factors. Or you may decide to schedule an additional meeting to address a challenge that has come up. Be sure that you deal with any risks or changes as a team in an organized fashion. For example, if a team member drops out of the course, you may decide to reallocate his/her duties among the remaining team members. It is important that all team members are involved in any team sessions held to address changes and that any decisions made are put in writing and communicated to all team members.</p>

<h2 class="bullet">ASSIGNMENTS DUE THIS WEEK:</h2>
<p><strong>Project Proposal (25 points) Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday 5/21&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2 class="bullet">UPCOMING ASSIGNMENTS:</h2>
<p><strong>Progress Report (10 points) Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday, 6/4</strong></p>
<p>Your progress report should be in memo format addressed to Dr. Flammia. The progress report should cover three major topics: Progress to Date, Anticipated Progress, and Problems/Solutions. Be sure to specify dates for the time period covered by the Progress to Date and Anticipated Progress sections.</p>
<p>In the Problems/Solutions section you should detail any unexpected changes to the project, any challenges you encountered, and anything else relevant to the project and its current status not covered in the first two sections of the report. A good progress report will not merely state a problem, but will go on to discuss how you solved it or how you plan to solve it.</p>
<p>The progress report should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs with headings to organize the content. You should not use lists or tables in the report. Do not include a schedule chart within the report. If you feel it is necessary to include a schedule, it should be an attachment to the report.</p>
