<h1>Module 3</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Objectives:</h2>
<ol class="paddedlist">
<li>To review the Request for Proposal for the Research Report.</li>
<li>To discuss the major components of a project proposal.</li>
<li>To complete the development of the Project Proposal assignment.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bullet">Reading Assignment:</h2>
<ol class="paddedlist">
<li>Chapter 5.</li>
<li>Your team should also review Part II of our textbook (Chapters 10-18) to get ideas for the types of tools that you may wish to analyze in your Research Report. You can divide the reading of Chapters 10 through18 among the team and then report back to one another on the content of the chapters.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bullet">Responding to a Request for Proposal (RFP)</h2>
<p>Often corporations and government agencies will issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) when they are seeking to hire a company or an individual to perform various jobs for them. When responding to an RFP it is important that you include all the requested information and answer all of your readers' questions. It is also important that you follow the precise format requested in the RFP. Sometimes government agencies will not even consider a proposal if it deviates at all from the requested format.</p>
<p>When you write the proposal for your Research Report, you should take care to be sure that you follow the instructions given in the RFP. You should include all the required sections and attachments, and you should include thorough and detailed information in each section of the proposal. Your proposal should describe your proposed project very clearly and specifically so that your reader has no unanswered questions regarding either the nature of your project or your plans for completing it. Your grade will be affected if you fail to develop the various sections of the proposal in thorough and specific detail. Remember that the proposal is a formal business document.</p>
<h2>Project Planning and Tracking</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 in our textbook offers some useful advice on project planning and tracking. Be sure to refer to this chapter when developing the Team Structure and Management Plan, Contingency Plans, and Schedule sections of your proposal.</p>
<p>In order to create a thorough and realistic schedule for your proposal, you will need to break down all the tasks associated with the completion of your project. You can begin by noting major milestones (dates by which certain key stages of your project will be completed) and deliverables (progress report, rough draft, final draft). However, you should strive to make your schedule more detailed than merely a listing of the due dates for assignments. You should try to break your project tasks down in as much detail as you can (see the Sample Detailed Task List on page 103 in Chapter 5).</p>
<p>While you will not want to put that level of detail in your schedule chart, it might be a good idea to attach to your proposal a detailed task list together with the names of the team member(s) responsible for each task.</p>
<h2>Preparing Your Project Proposal</h2>
<p>Be sure that your proposal includes all the information requested in the RFP. Review the assignment and the RFP carefully before turning in your proposal on Wednesday, 5/21. Be sure to proofread the final draft of your proposal very carefully.</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Project Proposal (25 points) Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday, 5/21</h2>
<p>In the proposal you should discuss the technologies that your team plans to evaluate in the Research Report. Your proposal should discuss the structure and management of your team; you should designate a team leader and any other roles that team members will play. Your proposal should include a description of your contingency plans. You should also include your schedule and your plans for reviewing and editing your Report.</p>
<p>Your proposal should be a response to the Request for Proposal (RFP) that follows <strong>and</strong> should use the format of the RFP as a model for the format of your proposal.</p>
<dl class="normal"><dt><strong>To:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Students in ENC 4298</strong></dt><dt><strong>From:&nbsp; </strong><strong>Dr. Flammia</strong></dt><dt><strong>Re:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Request for Proposal (RFP) for Research Report</strong></dt><dt><strong>Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; May 12, 2014</strong><strong></strong></dt></dl><hr />
<p>The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to request that each team submit a detailed and specific proposal describing all aspects of the team's plans for completing the Research Report.</p>
<p>The proposal should convince Dr. Flammia that your team has a well-developed and carefully designed management plan, a realistic schedule, appropriate tools, and strategies for addressing the challenges related to virtual collaboration.</p>
<p>Your proposal must include these sections: Introduction, Description of Report Content, Team Structure and Management Plan, Contingency Plans, Schedule (including a Gantt chart), Collaborative Tools, Review and Evaluation Plans, and Conclusion. Each section should include detailed information, and may include attachments, if necessary. Every proposal must include a Gantt chart as an attachment to the Schedule section.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The introduction is the only section that does not require a heading. The introduction should be a brief statement of the purpose of the proposal; the purpose is to request approval of your plans for carrying out the virtual team project. The introduction should also include a <strong>brief</strong> statement describing the technologies that you plan to research. The next section, Description of Report Content, will contain your detailed description of the technologies your team plans to analyze.</p>
<h3>Description of Report Content</h3>
<p>Give an overview of each of the technologies that your team plans to research, test, and analyze. Remember that your team should analyze one technology per team member; therefore, a team with five members should research five separate and distinct technologies. Be sure to explain why each technology is appropriate for inclusion in a report on tools for virtual collaboration.</p>
<h3>Team Structure and Management Plan</h3>
<p>In this section you should describe the division of labor within your team, specifically stating which responsibilities each team member will have. You should indicate which team member(s) is going to serve as the team leader and designate any other roles that team members will fulfill (editor, troubleshooter, technical support person). You are only required to designate a team leader, the other roles are optional. You should clearly delineate the responsibilities associated with each position. Be sure to mention specific actions and duties. For example, do not merely say, the team leader will communicate with the team. Instead say, the team leader will send email reminders to all team members before each meeting.&nbsp; You should also specify which technology each team member is responsible for researching.</p>
<h3>Contingency Plans</h3>
<p>Chapter 4 in our textbook discusses communication among team members and offers suggestions for improving communication within a virtual team. Chapter 6 focuses on some of the challenges that may arise during the course of a virtual collaboration. Virtual teams may face challenges related to technology, time, and interpersonal communication. This section of the proposal should detail your plans for maintaining strong communication, preventing and/or resolving conflict, and addressing technical problems.</p>
<p>You should have a plan in place for dealing with time lost due to technical problems or other unavoidable delays. You should discuss in precise detail your process for resolving conflict among team members and for addressing the issue of non-participating team members.&nbsp; Having well-developed contingency plans can be the deciding factor in the success of your collaboration.</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>Your schedule should reflect careful planning for all aspects of your project: researching, drafting, designing, reviewing, and editing your Research Report. You should include milestones, dates by which certain key stages of your project will be completed. Include <strong>both</strong> a brief prose summary of your schedule and milestones and a Gantt chart which shows the various activities you will perform over time.</p>
<p>Attach your Gantt chart in an appendix to your document and be sure to refer to its location in the text under the <strong>Schedule</strong> heading. Remember that your purpose in this section is to persuade your reader that you have planned well, that you have allotted adequate time for each phase of the project, and that you can meet your deadlines.</p>
<p>Your schedule should include all team meetings (you must have at least one meeting per week) and all deliverables associated with the project (progress report and peer review).</p>
<h3>Collaborative Tools</h3>
<p>This section should describe in detail all the tools you will use for collaboration. You may include the technologies that you are researching in this section; however, you do not need to describe them in detail again. You should describe any other technologies you will use in addition to those technologies you are researching. Be sure to explain how you will use each tool. Any technologies that you choose to use must be available to all members of the team.</p>
<h3>Review and Editing Plans</h3>
<p>The purpose of this section is to describe your review process. In other words, how you plan to seek feedback on your work from reviewers outside your team and how you plan to review the work of your teammates. You should plan to conduct at least two reviews of your document in addition to the required peer review assignment.&nbsp; You should review the first draft once each team member has completed his or her section of the document. Then you should review the document a second time after the Introduction and Conclusion and all required sections have been added. During this second review, you should strive to make sure that the document has a consistent tone and writing style.</p>
<p>After the second review, you should also carefully edit the document for both writing style and format. You will want to be sure that the writing style is correct and consistent. You should also check that the format adheres to the guidelines given in the Research Report Template.</p>
<p>You may choose to designate one team member as the editor, but all team members must participate in reviewing the document.</p>
<p>All your review and editing plans should be clearly stated in this section of the proposal, including the dates when reviews will occur and the individuals who will take part in the reviews in addition to your team members.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Your conclusion should be brief. Restate your commitment to and enthusiasm for the project. Use the conclusion as an opportunity to create one final positive impression in the reader's mind.</p>
<h3>Final Points</h3>
<p>Your proposal is a serious, professional document. Just as a resume is often the sole document that represents an individual, your proposal must stand alone to represent your team. Be sure that your proposal is clearly written and well organized. Put it in the memo format and use headings and adequate white space to make it attractive and readable. Proofread your proposal carefully, and make sure that it is error free.</p>
<h2 class="bullet">The Importance of the Project Proposal for the Research Report</h2>
<p>The proposal that you develop for your Research Report can serve as a valuable planning document for your project. You should be sure that you put as much detailed and specific information as possible into your proposal. As you work on your Research Report throughout the semester, your proposal can be a source of guidance regarding what needs to be done when. It can serve as an informal contract among team members regarding the roles and responsibilities they will each fulfill. The proposal can provide guidelines for dealing with any challenges that may arise during the course of the project. Do not underestimate the value of a well-developed proposal to the success of your virtual team collaboration. A thorough and well-written proposal may prevent misunderstanding and save time during crucial periods in the semester.</p>
<p>Be sure to proofread your proposal carefully before turning it in. Then, once you have turned in the proposal assignment, you should begin the research phase of your project. Do not waste time. Begin researching as soon as the proposal is complete.</p>
