<h2 class="bullet">The Revision Phase:</h2>
<p>Based on the feedback you received from your peer reviews, spend time this week revising your Research Report. You should focus your revision efforts on three aspects of your Research Report: writing style, format, and content.</p>
<h3>Writing Style:</h3>
<p>For help revising your writing style, you may wish to have a consultation at the University Writing Center. They offer online consultations for those of you who do not come to campus. The Writing Center is a free service that you pay for with your tuition, so you should take advantage of it.</p>
<p>You can also ask me, Dr. Flammia, to help you with any aspect of your style that you want to strengthen. I will be happy to help you.</p>
<h3>Format:</h3>
<p>Remember that format is extremely important in a technical document. The best way to have a strong format is to edit it for consistency. Go through the document several times, editing for a different aspect of the format each time (numbering of steps, numbering of figures, bulleted lists, page numbering, hierarchy of headings, and placement of graphics).</p>
<p>In addition to your peer reviews in class, try to find friends who are good editors and ask them to review your format for consistency. Again, feel free to ask me for any assistance you may need.</p>
<h3>Content:</h3>
<p>When revising your content, strive to make the sections of the Report describing each of the technologies roughly equivalent in length, depth of detail, and use of supporting material. Be sure that all of your main points are supported by relevant research. Work to integrate your research smoothly into your Report. Review your References section carefully for completeness and correctness. Remember that you should use the MLA documentation style for your References section.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions as you revise your Research Report.</p>
