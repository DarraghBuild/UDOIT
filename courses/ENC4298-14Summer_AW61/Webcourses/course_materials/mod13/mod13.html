<h2 class="bullet">Project Evaluation Phase</h2>
<p>When you complete a team project, you may wish to move on to the next project very quickly, you may wish to forget the frustrations of that particular project, or you may simply wish to take a break. However, before you do any of these things, it is a good idea to evaluate the successes and failures of the project you have just completed. In some instances, you may be required to do so formally for your employer or client. In any case, when you look back at the project later on you will be glad that you recorded your assessment of the project while it was still fresh in your mind.</p>
<h3>Project Metrics:</h3>
<p>In Chapter 9 our textbook discusses some methods of project evaluation. Project metrics are means of developing a quantifiable assessment of a project.</p>
<p>You may choose to measure how much time was spent on various aspects of a project. Hours per page is an industry standard in the field of technical communication. The Society for Technical Communication has reported 5 hours per page as an average for the production of technical documentation in general and 7 hours per page for high-tech information products. It is useful to know the approximate number of hours you spend to produce a page of documentation, particularly if you want to work on a freelance basis and know how to quote a job accurately. Of course, there are many other ways to measure productivity. Some of these include how well you met deadlines and how well you were able to monitor and accommodate change throughout the course of the project. Another important consideration is the level of quality of your finished product.</p>
<p>Table 9-1 on page 193 in our textbook suggests different types of measurements that you might use to evaluate a project.</p>
<h3>Team Performance:</h3>
<p>For team projects you will, of course, want to evaluate the performance of the team as a whole as well as the performance of each individual member of the team. But for every project, you will want to evaluate the process, the product, and the effectiveness of your management of the project. Some points to consider when evaluating the success of the project include:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>How accurate was your initial estimate of the scope of the project?</li>
<li>How realistic was your schedule?</li>
<li>How realistic was your budget?</li>
<li>How closely did you follow your original proposal?</li>
<li>Did you control the activities of the project as you planned to or did you end up just writing frantically to get the project done?</li>
<li>Do you feel you did a better job on some aspects of the project than you did on others?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some questions that you might want to consider at the completion of a project; of course, all of these questions may not apply to every project.</p>
<h3>Team Management:</h3>
<p>If you managed a team of technical communicators to produce a project, you will want to evaluate how well the team worked together and examine any problems that occurred and detracted from effective functioning of the team. You will also want to evaluate the performance and productivity of the individual members of the team. If you will be managing the same team or any of the same individuals again in the future, it is especially valuable to know how productive each team member is and what his/her individual strengths and weaknesses are. This knowledge will help you assign roles and responsibilities in future projects. You may also wish to evaluate how successful you were as a leader of the team and what you might want to do differently on future projects to enhance the successful functioning of the team.</p>
<p>Even if you worked on a project alone, you should evaluate how well you managed the document development process. Some questions to ask include:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Did you maintain good working relationships with source persons, clients, subject matter experts, and any other personnel you worked with in order to complete the project?</li>
<li>Did you meet all your milestones and stay within your budget?</li>
<li>Do you feel that your finished project will meet the audience's needs?</li>
<li>Did you keep an accurate record of all the time spent on the project so that you will be able to estimate your next project more accurately?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges Unique to Virtual Teams:</h3>
<p>You may also wish to reflect on how well your team met the challenges of collaborating virtually. Some questions related to the challenges of working in a virtual team include:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Did the team develop a shared vision for the project and maintain that vision throughout the course of the project?</li>
<li>Did the communication tools your team used provide all the support needed to complete your project?</li>
<li>Did all team members feel engaged in the project or were some team members isolated?</li>
<li>Was conflict managed and resolved in a positive manner?</li>
<li>Were team members able to adapt to one another's different work and communication styles?</li>
<li>Did the team have effective leadership?</li>
<li>Were all team members collegial and cooperative?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project Wrap-Up Report:</h3>
<p>You can record your project evaluation in a project wrap-up report which is an important part of the project history. The information contained in the wrap-up report may prove invaluable when producing other similar projects in the future.</p>
<h3>Individual Memo</h3>
<p>While you are not required to write a formal wrap-up report as a team, each team member will be required to write an Individual Memo to Dr. Flammia discussing the experience of working as part of a virtual team. Do not overlook the importance of this memo as it is your opportunity to demonstrate what you contributed to the team and what you learned from your participation in the project.</p>
<h2 class="bullet">ASSIGNMENTS DUE THIS WEEK:</h2>
<p><strong>Research Report (25 points) Due by 11:59 pm Thursday, 6/19</strong></p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<ul class="nobullet paddedlist">
<li><strong>Individual Memo (20 points) Due by 11:59 pm Thursday, 6/19</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your Individual Memo should be in memo format addressed to Dr. Flammia. You should begin the memo with a very brief description of the technologies that your team researched. Then you should go on to discuss these topics:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Your specific contributions to the team</li>
<li>A description any roles that you took on in your team (leader, troubleshooter, peace maker, and so on)</li>
<li>Your impressions of working in a virtual team (including whether or not you would wish to do so again)</li>
<li>Any problems you encountered and how you handled them</li>
<li>The most valuable things you learned from doing the project</li>
<li>New skills you developed during the course of the project</li>
<li>The way this project has improved your project management skills</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to use headings to organize your memo. You should discuss each topic in detail. Your memo should be two to three single-spaced pages in length. It should not be longer than three single-spaced pages.</p>
<p>Then, include a separate page (in addition to the required 2-3 page limit) with the answers to these questions on team leadership. The purpose of these questions is not to evaluate individual students who served as team leaders, but rather to study different team leadership structures and their effectiveness.</p>
<p>What was your team's leadership structure? One leader, two leaders, rotating leadership, other?</p>
<p>How satisfied were you with your team leader(s). Be as specific as possible about the team's structure, functioning, and success. Try to avoid focusing on personality issues.</p>
<p>If you were a team leader, how would you evaluate your effectiveness as a leader. Are there things you will do differently the next time you lead a team?</p>
<p>Would you want to be in a team with the same leadership structure again? Explain why or why not.</p>
<p>Were there team members who were not designated as leaders who took on a leadership role? Did their actions help the team succeed? Explain why or why not.</p>
