<ol class="paddedlist">
<li>To introduce the challenges inherent in virtual teamwork.</li>
<li>To introduce the Research Report assignment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Textbook:</h2>

<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Reading Assignment:</h2>
<p>Chapter 1.</p>
<p><strong>Note: All reading assignments given are from our textbook. However, in order to conduct research throughout the semester you will want to be sure that you have remote access to the library. Through EZ Proxy, you can access the library remotely.</strong></p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">EZ Proxy</h2>
<p>Access to most of the Libraries' databases and electronic journals from off campus is limited to <strong>faculty, staff, and currently enrolled UCF students</strong> and requires that you use EZProxy to login.</p>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li><strong>Enter</strong> your <strong><em>activated</em></strong> Library ID number (your Library ID number begins with 221 and is printed on your UCF card).</li>
<li><strong>Click</strong> the Login button, and then <strong>click</strong> "Yes" to accept the <em>Security Alert(s).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you need a UCF ID card, contact the <a href="http://www.ucfcard.ucf.edu">UCF Card Office</a>. If you are a Distance Student, you can request a Library ID number by submitting a <a href="http://library.ucf.edu/Circulation/ID/IDRequestForm.asp">Library ID Request form</a> online or by calling the Circulation Desk (Orlando Campus) at 407-823-2580.</p>
<h3>Activating your Library ID number:</h3>
<p>Your Library ID number is <strong><em>not activated</em></strong> until it is scanned at a Circulation Desk or you submit an activation request. If you have not checked out materials in the Libraries, you probably need to activate your number.</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Stop at the Circulation Desk and have your card scanned <strong><em>or</em></strong></li>
<li>Submit a <a href="http://library.ucf.edu/Circulation/ID/ActivationRequestForm.asp">Library ID Activation Request form</a> online.</li>

<h2 class="bullet">Introduction:</h2>
<p>Teamwork plays an important role in the modern workplace, and nearly all teams in the business world rely on some virtual communication to accomplish their goals. Virtual teams can be defined as those teams who rely on technology to some degree to work across time, space, geographical borders, and organizational boundaries. Virtual teams allow for greater flexibility and make possible cross-functional coordination of activities within an organization. Virtual teams can save the cost of travel and relocation and can also facilitate information sharing and knowledge creation.</p>
<p>As our textbook explains, to be successful a virtual team must have a "shared team objective." Team members must all have the same understanding of what the project entails and how to achieve their shared objective. Leadership and tools are also crucial to the success of virtual teams. There are now many collaborative tools available to members of virtual teams; each team must select the tools that are best suited to the needs of its members.</p>
<p>Finally, all successful teams need leadership. Leaders may play different roles depending of the nature of the team that they are leading. However, all teams need a clearly defined structure that includes the designation of a leader or leaders. Some successful teams may have more than one leader; for example, in a successful collaboration between US and Irish students, the team had one leader in each location. Further, some teams may choose to rotate leadership duties among the team members with each team member taking the lead during a different phase of the project. However, some clearly defined leadership is essential to a team's ability to function effectively. Table 1-1 on pages 14 and 15 in our textbook displays key dimensions of leadership. This table may help you as you determine what qualities to look for in a team leader.</p>
<p>Researchers Kayworth and Leidner (2000) divide the challenges faced by virtual teams into four categories:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Culture</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Project Management<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<p class="bib">1 T. Kayworth and D. Leidner, "The global virtual manager: A prescription for success," <cite>European Management Journal</cite>, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 183-194, 2000.</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Communication:</h2>
<p>Virtual teams face challenges related to communication because they must communicate without the benefit of nonverbal cues that often convey a large portion of the meaning in any exchange. Further, teams do not always have the luxury of synchronous (real-time) communication; in many cases they have to rely on email and other media that do not allow for immediate feedback. Further, team members are frequently at the mercy of technology, and they may face serious challenges when technology breaks down.</p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Culture:</h2>
<p>Because virtual collaboration makes it possible to work across national borders, virtual teams may be composed of members from diverse cultures around the world. Team members must strive to understand cultural differences, particularly those differences that may influence communication styles, work habits, and other aspects of teamwork.</p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Technology:</h2>
<p>While technology has the potential to facilitate remote communication, team members must be careful to choose those technologies that are best suited to the types of tasks that they will perform. Some communication media are better suited to group discussion and file sharing than others. Each team must choose the tools that will help team members address logistical challenges; when selecting tools the team should consider the preferred communication styles of team members. The nature and scope of the project will also have an impact on the selection of tools.</p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Project Management:</h2>
<p>Effective leadership is crucial to the success of any team, but it becomes even more essential when dealing with virtual teams. Project management duties may all reside with the team leader or they may be shared among team members; either way, it will be very important that all roles and responsibilities are clearly understood and agreed upon by all team members from the beginning of the project.</p>
<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">Major Project for the Course</h2>
<p>In this course, the major project will be a Research Report analyzing collaborative technologies. All other short assignments will be related to the major project. (<strong>See Description of Assignments</strong> for a full description of all the assignments for the course with due dates and the number of points each is worth.)</p>
<p>At the end of each Module, there will be a reminder of the assignments due that week and of upcoming assignments.</p>
