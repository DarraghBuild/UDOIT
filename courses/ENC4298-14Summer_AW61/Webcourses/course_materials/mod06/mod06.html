<p><strong>Progress Report (10 points) Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday, 6/4</strong></p>
<p>Your progress report should be in memo format addressed to Dr. Flammia. The progress report should cover three major topics: Progress to Date, Anticipated Progress, and Problems/Solutions. Be sure to specify dates for the time period covered by the Progress to Date and Anticipated Progress sections.</p>
<p>In the Problems/Solutions section you should detail any unexpected changes to the project, any challenges you encountered, and anything else relevant to the project and its current status not covered in the first two sections of the report. A good progress report will not merely state a problem, but will go on to discuss how you solved it or how you plan to solve it.</p>
<p>The progress report should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs with headings to organize the content. You should not use lists or tables in the report. Do not include a schedule chart within the report. If you feel it is necessary to include a schedule, it should be an attachment to the report.</p>
