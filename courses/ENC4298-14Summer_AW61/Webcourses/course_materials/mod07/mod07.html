<h2>Writing Progress Reports</h2>
<p>Bear in mind that in addition to being functional documents, progress reports are also persuasive documents. Progress reports are usually written to clients or upper management to inform them of your accomplishments on a particular project. A progress report may have multiple audiences that include members of your own organization and your client's organization.</p>
<p>Often progress reports are brief. While they seem merely to report a set of facts, do not overlook their persuasive elements. A progress report should cover three types of information: past progress, anticipated progress, and problems/solutions. Depending on the nature and scope of your project, you may need to write numerous progress reports or only a few during the period that you work on it. For some projects, you may need to report as frequently as every two weeks. For others, the period between reports will be much longer.</p>
<p>When writing a progress report, make it clear what period of time is covered by your report and specify dates, Progress from 5/26/14 through 6/2/14. You should be equally precise when discussing anticipated progress, Progress Anticipated from 6/3/14 through 6/16/14.</p>
<p>When discussing past progress, state your accomplishments clearly and concisely. Use active verbs. Give specific numbers rather than using vague adjectives. For example, <em>Completed a 360-page first draft of the manual.</em> Not, <em>An extensive first draft of the manual was completed.</em> You can persuade the reader that you have accomplished a great deal of work without using a lot of words. Think in terms of stating your accomplishments on a resume. Be active and precise in your language. Make it easy for the reader to get a lot of specific information about the project quickly.</p>
<p>When discussing anticipated progress, avoid being overly optimistic. Always stick to the milestones laid down in your Project Proposal. If you are on schedule, you won't need to explain too much in this section. Emphasize your ability to stay on schedule and within your budget. Remind the readers of any responsibilities they have in relation to your future progress. In other words, do they need to provide you with reviews or information in order for you to make the progress you anticipate? If so, make sure they are reminded of their obligations clearly and concisely.</p>
<p>When discussing problems/solutions, if at all possible put the emphasis on the solutions. Small internal issues related to team management need not be relayed to readers. However, your clients and upper management will need to be informed of problems related to your schedule and budget. If you are unable to meet a project milestone or if you are going over budget, you must address these problems directly. It is important to address them as soon as they arise, as ultimately your clients will be aware if the schedule is not met or if you are unable to stay within budget.</p>
<p>When stating problems, present them with solutions attached if you can. If you cannot, state the problem in a clear and straightforward manner. Suggest any ideas you have for addressing the problem. Do not withhold critical information from your readers simply because it is not pleasant. Use your persuasive powers to present the unpleasant information in the most positive light you can. Remember that progress reports are highly persuasive documents.</p>

<h2 class="bullet">ASSIGNMENTS DUE THIS WEEK:</h2>
<p><strong>Progress Report (10 points) Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday, 6/4&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Your progress report should be in memo format addressed to Dr. Flammia. The progress report should cover three major topics: Progress to Date, Anticipated Progress, and Problems/Solutions. Be sure to specify dates for the Progress to Date and Anticipated Progress sections.</p>
<p>In the Problems/Solutions section you should detail any unexpected changes to the project, any challenges you encountered, and anything else relevant to the project and its current status not covered in the first two sections of the report. A good progress report will not merely state a problem, but will go on to discuss how you solved it or how you plan to solve it.</p>
<p>The progress report should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs with headings to organize the content. You should not use lists or tables in the report. Do not include a schedule chart within the report. If you feel it is necessary to include a schedule, it should be an attachment to the report.</p>
