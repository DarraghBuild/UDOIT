<h2 class="bullet">The Review Phase:</h2>
<p>In Chapter 7 our textbook discusses several different types of reviews. Although much of the information presented in Chapter 7 is not directly relevant to our class project, it will certainly be relevant to your professional career. In fact, in your work experience many of you may have already participated in some or all of the different types of reviews described in our text. However, for the purposes of our class project, you should focus on getting feedback on three areas of your Research Report from your peer reviewers; these three areas are the writing style, the format, and the content.</p>
<p>In Module 6 we discussed conducting internal reviews of your Report, that is having members of your team review each other's work. Now you will conduct external reviews, that is having students in our class who are not members of your team review your Report.</p>
<p>You should use these peer review guidelines as a starting point for your peer reviews. A good review will address all of the questions posed in the guidelines. However, you should feel free to comment on additional points not covered by the questions given.</p>
<h2>Peer Review Guidelines:</h2>
<p>When conducting a peer review, you should be sure to address the writing style, format, and content of the document you are reviewing in an organized and thorough manner.</p>
<h3>Writing Style:</h3>
<p>A peer review of Writing Style should address these questions:</p>
<ol class="paddedlist">
<li>Is the Research Report clearly written?</li>
<li>Is the writing style consistent throughout the Research Report?</li>
<li>Is the level of the language appropriate for a formal report (no slang, no contractions, all abbreviations spelled out fully)?</li>
<li>Has the Report been carefully edited?</li>
<li>Based on your answers to questions 1 through 4, briefly summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the writing style of the Research Report. Make specific suggestions for revision.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Format:</h3>
<p>Remember that format is extremely important in a technical document. Your reviewers can give you feedback as to whether or not your Report adheres to the guidelines given to you in the Research Report Template. A peer review of Format should address these questions:</p>
<ol class="paddedlist">
<li>Is the page layout consistent and professional throughout?</li>
<li>Is a clear hierarchy of information created through the use of headings?</li>
<li>Are graphics and text smoothly integrated? Are graphics clearly labeled and referred to by their labels in the text?</li>
<li>Is the page layout balanced?</li>
<li>Is the front and back matter well handled?</li>
<li>Is the overall format consistent?</li>
<li>Based on your answers to questions 1 through 6, briefly summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the format of the Research Report. Make specific suggestions for revision.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Content:</h3>
<p>A peer review of Content should address these questions:</p>
<ol class="paddedlist">
<li>Does the Report include all the required sections as described in the template?</li>
<li>Are the sections on each technology developed in roughly equivalent detail?</li>
<li>Are examples given to illustrate the points made regarding the usefulness of each technology for virtual teamwork?</li>
<li>Are references to research sources used to support the points made in the analysis of each technology?</li>
<li>Are research sources smoothly integrated into the Report?</li>
<li>Is a complete list of sources included in the References section? Is the use of the MLA format correct in the References section?</li>
<li>Based on your answers to questions 1 through 6, briefly summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the content of the Research Report. Make specific suggestions for revision.</li>
