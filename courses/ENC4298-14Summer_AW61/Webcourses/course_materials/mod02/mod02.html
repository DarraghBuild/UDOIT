<h2 class="bullet">Structuring Your Team and Planning for the Major Project</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 in our textbook discusses the process of setting up a virtual team. As a manager in the workplace, you may face the challenge of hiring employees to work on a virtual team; as students in our class, you will have the opportunity to select a group of classmates to collaborate with on the major project for the course. The major project is to write a Research Report analyzing tools for virtual collaboration. <strong>If you have not already done so, you should read over the description of the Research Report assignment before completing this module.</strong></p>
<p>The main focus of our class is best practices for virtual teamwork. The major project for our course is for your team to write a Research Report on collaborative technologies (including blogs, wikis, podcasts, and chat tools). Each team member will be responsible for selecting a different technology and proposing it to the team for inclusion in the Report. Then the team will use each of the technologies selected to test its effectiveness for collaborative work. Finally, each team member will be responsible for writing an analysis of one of the technologies.</p>
<p>When setting up your team, you will need to select a team leader or leaders and define the roles of all team members. When roles and responsibilities are clearly defined from the outset of a project, it is much less likely that disagreements will arise or that work will be duplicated or left undone. Do not underestimate the importance of taking the time to come to an agreement regarding the structure of your team and the roles of all team members. The first major decision will be selecting a team leader.</p>
<h2>Selecting a Team Leader</h2>
<p>In the business world, you typically will not have the freedom to choose your team leader; however, for the purposes of our class project each team will choose its own leader. You have several options for handling the leadership position in your team:</p>
<ol class="paddedlist">
<li>You may choose one student to serve as team leader throughout the entire project.</li>
<li>You may choose two students to share the role of team leader; if you choose this option, you must clearly separate the roles/responsibilities of the two leaders and explain the structure in your Project Proposal.</li>
<li>You may choose to rotate the leadership among all team members; if you choose this option, you must clearly define the time period during which each team member will serve as team leader in your Project Proposal.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your team fails to select a leader or if a disagreement regarding leadership arises during the course of the project that your team cannot resolve, then Dr. Flammia will appoint a team leader.</p>
<p>When selecting a team leader, consider and discuss with your team members what you expect the leader to do. Then discuss the responsibilities that should be shared among team members. Each team may have its own ideas about what makes a good leader and what a leader should be responsible for within the team structure.</p>
<p>For a team to succeed, it is important that ideas are shared openly at the beginning of the project and that all team guidelines are written up in your team's Project Proposal. The Project Proposal assignment is due on Wednesday, 5/21. The Proposal serves as a kind of contract among team members. In the Team Structure and Management Plan section of the Proposal, you will delineate all aspects of your team's plans for dividing responsibilities, communicating among team members, and handling the decision-making process.</p>
<h2>Teambuilding Exercises</h2>
<p>Before selecting a team leader, it is important for all team members to express their expectations of a leader and their ideas about the qualities that they would like to see in a leader. It will be easier to select a leader after you have taken a little time to get to know the other members of your team. Before selecting a leader, you may want to engage in one of the teambuilding activities suggested for virtual teams on pages 53-55 in our textbook. These activities may not be necessary if you already know the members of your team from other classes.</p>
<p>It is up to your team whether or not you want to perform one of the teambuilding exercises. However, even if your team chooses not to do so, you should take time to get to know something about one another. Researchers have found that the most successful virtual teams are those teams that establish social communication early in the lifecycle of a project. In order for teams to succeed, team members must build trust in one another. Coppola, Hiltz, and Rotter (2004) offer virtual team members four suggestions for building trust:</p>
<ul class="paddedlist">
<li>Establish early communication.</li>
<li>Develop a positive social atmosphere.</li>
<li>Reinforce predictable patterns in communication and action.</li>
<li>Involve team members in tasks.<sup><a href="#foot_1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p class="bib" id="foot_1">1 N. W. Coppola, S. R. Hiltz, and N. G. Rotter, "Building trust in virtual teams," <cite>IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication</cite>, vol. 47, no. 2, pp. 95-104, 2004.</p>
<p>You do not have to become close friends with your teammates, but you must find a way to build a congenial working relationship. If you do so, you will find it much easier to meet all of the many challenges inherent in virtual teamwork.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, our textbook offers several suggestions for building a team culture. Your team may use some of these suggestions or may develop your own strategies for creating a positive working relationship. Just keep in mind that making sure your team functions well requires conscious effort; you must take the time to get to know one another and you must strive to understand and respect viewpoints different from your own. Virtual teamwork is work that requires effort, but putting in the effort at the start of a project can ensure a positive, productive, and enjoyable team experience.</p>
<h2>Tool Selection</h2>
<p>Chapter 3 in our textbook discusses the selection of tools for virtual team collaboration. The evaluation of collaborative technologies is the focus of the Research Report that is the major project for our course. You can begin working on research for that Report right away by selecting tools to use for your initial team meetings and incorporating them into the Research Report. You will need to research one technology per team member, and each team member will be responsible for writing the section of your Report on his/her technology. Your first task once you have formed a team will be to schedule a meeting for this week.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Team Meetings</h2>
<p>Chapter 4 in our textbook offers useful advice for conducting team meetings including special notes for different types of meetings. An example of meeting minutes is also given in Chapter 4 on page 94.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your team should have weekly meetings every week starting this week. The weekly meeting should be held in real time using the technology of your choice (chat, Skype, collaborative software).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The weekly meetings are a minimum requirement. Your team may choose to have more than one meeting per week.</p>

<div class="hr"><hr /></div>
<h2 class="bullet">UPCOMING ASSIGNMENTS:</h2>
<p><strong>Project Proposal (25 points) Due by 11:59 pm Wednesday, 5/21</strong></p>
<p>In the proposal you should discuss the technologies that your team plans to evaluate in the Research Report. Your proposal should discuss the structure and management of your team; you should designate a team leader and any other roles that team members will play. Your proposal should include a description of your contingency plans. You should also include your schedule and your plans for reviewing and editing your Report.</p>
<p>Your proposal should be a response to the Request for Proposal (RFP) that follows <strong>and</strong> should use the format of the RFP as a model for the format of your proposal.</p>
<dl class="normal"><dt><strong>To:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Students in ENC 4298</strong></dt><dt><strong>From:&nbsp; </strong><strong>Dr. Flammia</strong></dt><dt><strong>Re:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Request for Proposal (RFP) for Research Report</strong></dt><dt><strong>Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; May 12, 2014</strong><strong></strong></dt></dl><hr />
<p>The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to request that each team submit a detailed and specific proposal describing all aspects of the team's plans for completing the Research Report.</p>
<p>The proposal should convince Dr. Flammia that your team has a well-developed and carefully designed management plan, a realistic schedule, appropriate tools, and strategies for addressing the challenges related to virtual collaboration.</p>
<p>Your proposal must include these sections: Introduction, Description of Report Content, Team Structure and Management Plan, Contingency Plans, Schedule (including a Gantt chart), Collaborative Tools, Review and Evaluation Plans, and Conclusion. Each section should include detailed information, and may include attachments, if necessary. Every proposal must include a Gantt chart as an attachment to the Schedule section.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The introduction is the only section that does not require a heading. The introduction should be a brief statement of the purpose of the proposal; the purpose is to request approval of your plans for carrying out the virtual team project. The introduction should also include a <strong>brief</strong> statement describing the technologies that you plan to research. The next section, Description of Report Content, will contain your detailed description of the technologies your team plans to analyze.</p>
<h4>Description of Report Content</h4>
<p>Give an overview of each of the technologies that your team plans to research, test, and analyze. Remember that your team should analyze one technology per team member; therefore, a team with five members should research five separate and distinct technologies. Be sure to explain why each technology is appropriate for inclusion in a report on tools for virtual collaboration.</p>
<h4>Team Structure and Management Plan</h4>
<p>In this section you should describe the division of labor within your team, specifically stating which responsibilities each team member will have. You should indicate which team member(s) is going to serve as the team leader and designate any other roles that team members will fulfill (editor, troubleshooter, technical support person). You are only required to designate a team leader, the other roles are optional. You should clearly delineate the responsibilities associated with each position. Be sure to mention specific actions and duties. For example, do not merely say, the team leader will communicate with the team. Instead say, the team leader will send email reminders to all team members before each meeting.&nbsp; You should also specify which technology each team member is responsible for researching.</p>
<h4>Contingency Plans</h4>
<p>Chapter 4 in our textbook discusses communication among team members and offers suggestions for improving communication within a virtual team. Chapter 6 focuses on some of the challenges that may arise during the course of a virtual collaboration. Virtual teams may face challenges related to technology, time, and interpersonal communication. This section of the proposal should detail your plans for maintaining strong communication, preventing and/or resolving conflict, and addressing technical problems.</p>
<p>You should have a plan in place for dealing with time lost due to technical problems or other unavoidable delays. You should discuss in precise detail your process for resolving conflict among team members and for addressing the issue of non-participating team members . Having well-developed contingency plans can be the deciding factor in the success of your collaboration.</p>
<h4>Schedule</h4>
<p>Your schedule should reflect careful planning for all aspects of your project: researching, drafting, designing, reviewing, and editing your Research Report. You should include milestones, dates by which certain key stages of your project will be completed. Include <strong>both</strong> a brief prose summary of your schedule and milestones and a Gantt chart which shows the various activities you will perform over time.</p>
<p>Attach your Gantt chart in an appendix to your document and be sure to refer to its location in the text under the <strong>Schedule</strong> heading. Remember that your purpose in this section is to persuade your reader that you have planned well, that you have allotted adequate time for each phase of the project, and that you can meet your deadlines.</p>
<p>Your schedule should include all team meetings (you must have at least one meeting per week) and all deliverables associated with the project (progress report and peer review).</p>
<h4>Collaborative Tools</h4>
<p>This section should describe in detail all the tools you will use for collaboration. You may include the technologies that you are researching in this section; however, you do not need to describe them in detail again. You should describe any other technologies you will use in addition to those technologies you are researching. Be sure to explain how you will use each tool. Any technologies that you choose to use must be available to all members of the team.</p>
<h4>Review and Editing Plans</h4>
<p>The purpose of this section is to describe your review process. In other words, how you plan to seek feedback on your work from reviewers outside your team and how you plan to review the work of your teammates. You should plan to conduct at least two reviews of your document in addition to the required peer review assignment.&nbsp; You should review the first draft once each team member has completed his or her section of the document. Then you should review the document a second time after the Introduction and Conclusion and all required sections have been added. During this second review, you should strive to make sure that the document has a consistent tone and writing style.</p>
<p>After the second review, you should also carefully edit the document for both writing style and format. You will want to be sure that the writing style is correct and consistent. You should also check that the format adheres to the guidelines given in the Research Report Template.</p>
<p>You may choose to designate one team member as the editor, but all team members must participate in reviewing the document.</p>
<p>All your review and editing plans should be clearly stated in this section of the proposal, including the dates when reviews will occur and the individuals who will take part in the reviews in addition to your team members.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Your conclusion should be brief. Restate your commitment to and enthusiasm for the project. Use the conclusion as an opportunity to create one final positive impression in the reader's mind.</p>
<h4>Final Points</h4>
<p>Your proposal is a serious, professional document. Just as a resume is often the sole document that represents an individual, your proposal must stand alone to represent your team. Be sure that your proposal is clearly written and well organized. Put it in the memo format and use headings and adequate white space to make it attractive and readable. Proofread your proposal carefully, and make sure that it is error free.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Research Report (25 points) Due by 11:59 pm Thursday, 6/19</strong></p>
<h4>Description of Project</h4>
<p>The team project is a Research Report on collaborative technologies (including blogs, wikis, podcasts, and chat tools). Each team member will be responsible for selecting a different technology and proposing it to the team for inclusion in the Report. Then the team will use each of the technologies selected to test its effectiveness for collaborative work. Finally, each team member will be responsible for writing an analysis of one of the technologies.</p>
<p>The analysis should cover a discussion/description of the advantages and disadvantages of using each technology for communication and collaborative work. The analysis of each technology should include references to journal articles, white papers, and textbooks, as well as the team's experiences with the technologies.</p>
<p>The Research Report will include an analysis of one technology per team member. The entire team must review and approve each member's individual analysis. In addition to the individual analyses, the Report should include a brief introduction and a conclusion that draws together the main points of the Report and makes recommendations for how these technologies could be used for virtual team collaboration specifically, and for team work in general.</p>
<p>The format of the Research Report should be based on the Research Report Template available under the Materials Button on the Course Home Page.</p>
<h4>Evaluation Criteria</h4>
<p>The Research Report will be evaluated based on its content, format, and writing style.</p>
<p><strong>Fifteen points will be awarded for the content.</strong> The content should include a thorough discussion of each tool evaluated by the team. The coverage of the tools should be consistent; that is to say, each tool should be discussed in approximately the same depth and include a well-developed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of using each technology for communication and collaborative work. Further the analyses should include references to journal articles, white papers, and textbooks, as well as the team members' own experiences with the technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Ten points will be awarded for the presentation of the information (format and writing style).</strong> The content of the Report should be well organized with a clear hierarchy of information. The Report should follow the template for the assignment. The writers should strive to integrate their separate research into a Report that has a unified voice. The writing style should be consistent. The references should be presented using the MLA style for referencing sources. The references section must be accurate and complete.</p>
