The Assessments 
          tool is used to deliver online tests/quizzes about course material. As with the 
          assessments in a regular classroom environment, the assessments in your online course
          give you the opportunity to gauge your understanding of course content 
          and receive feedback from your instructor.

		<h2>Assessment Types</h2>
		<div class="m3x">
  <p>In your online course, there are three types of assessments.</p>
  <h3>Quizzes</h3>
  
          <p>Quizzes are online tests that your instructor will use to test your knowledge of course content and for which you are assigned a grade.</p>
          <p><strong class="bl">Example:</strong> A quiz may be given to cover material in a particular module or lesson. They can also be midterm and final exams. </p>
         
  <h3>Self Tests</h3>
  <p>Self tests are online tests that allow you to test your knowledge of  course content.</p>
          <p>Self tests are purely for your own benefit. Although you receive a grade, the grade is not recorded and is not counted towards your final grade for the course.</p>
          <p><strong class="bl">Example:</strong> Self tests are often included in learning modules to allow you to gauge how well you understand the material that was covered.</p>

  <h3>Surveys</h3>
  <p>Surveys are anonymous online assessments for which no grades are assigned.<br />
          <br />
Your instructor can see whether you have completed the survey, but the survey submission itself is anonymous.</p>
          <p><strong class="bl">Example:</strong> Surveys are typically used to canvas students' opinions on an issue covered in class or to allow students to anonymously evaluate the course.</p>

<h2>Assessments Features</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>The assessments tool also has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some assessments have a time limit, while others provide an unlimited amount of time. Assessments with a time limit provide you with the amount of time you have left as you take the assessment. </li>
<li>Sometimes assessment questions appear all at once and sometimes they appear one at a time. You may have the option of revisiting questions after you have saved an answer.</li>
<li>You may be able to attempt some assessments more than once.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Assessments tool has been added to your course, it will appear under Course Tools. If you click the <strong>Assessments</strong> icon, you are taken to the main screen for the Assessments tool. Alternatively, your instructor may add an assessment to the Course Content Home, another folder, or the Action Menu of a learning module. If you click the assessment icon, you are taken to a screen that contains that specific assessment.</p>
<p>Now that you're familiar with the different types of assessments, let's look at navigating and using the Assessments tool.</p>
