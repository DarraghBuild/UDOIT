<h1>Navigating  Assessments</h1>
<div class="m3x">
  <p>When you access the Assessments tool from Course Tools in the left panel, you are taken to the main screen for the Assessments tool, which lists all of the assessments that are currently available to you.</p>
  <p class="c"><strong>The Assessments Screen</strong><br /><img src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/Assessments_Screen.jpg" alt="The Assessments screen" width="427" height="295" class="img_border" /></p>
   <p>Below the assessment title, you'll see the start time for the assessment, and, possibly, a brief description of the quiz. If you haven't yet viewed the assessment, the title appears in bold.  When you click an assessment title, an information page for the assessment opens.</p>

  <p class="c"><strong>Assessment Information</strong><br /><img src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/Quiz_Description_Screen.jpg" alt="Assessment Information" width="776" height="334" class="img_border" /> </p>
    <p>The assessment information screen lists the assessment's start and end times, how long you have to complete the assessment, how questions will be delivered to you, the number of attempts allowed, and, if applicable, the maximum grade. If you have more questions about the assessment or technical concerns, click <strong>Instructions and Troubleshooting</strong>. To begin the assessment, select the <strong>Begin Assessment</strong> button. </p>
