<h1>Navigating the Discussions</h1>
<div class="m3x">
<p>When you access the Discussions tool from Course Tools, you are taken to the main screen for the Discussions tool.</p>
<p class="c"><strong>The Discussions Screen</strong><br /><img src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/discussions_screen.jpg" alt="The Discussions screen" width="811" height="248" class="img_border" /></p>
<p>The Discussions screen lists all of the topics that are currently available to you. For each topic, the Discussions screen lists the total number of messages posted and the number of new messages. If you posted a message, next to <strong>All My Posts</strong> at the top of the screen, the number of replies to your message is listed.</p>
<p>From the Discussions screen, you can open topics or  replies to your messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>To view a topic and the messages posted to it, click its title.</li>
<li>To view all topics or all your posts, click <strong>All Topics</strong> or <strong>All My Posts </strong>(at the top of the screen) .</li>
</ul>
  <p>A screen containing all of the topic's messages  appears or the replies to your messages 
    appear in a pop-up window.
    </p> 
    <br />

  <p>    Let's look at navigating the Messages screen next.
