<body>
<h1>Common Tools</h1>
<div class="m3x">
<p>Some  tools are used throughout your online course. For example, you may be required to upload files or create Web pages within a variety of Webcourses@UCF tools.</p>
</div>

<h2>Adding Attachments</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>While using  various online tools, you may need to upload files from your local computer to your   course. For example, to submit an assignment, you may need to upload a Microsoft Word file that contains your submission, or you may want to  attach a file to a Mail message.</p>
<p>If uploading a file is an option within the tool you are using, you will see an <strong>Add Attachments</strong> button.  In this example, when creating Mail messages, the <strong>Add Attachments</strong> button appears at the bottom of the Create Message screen.</p>

<p>When you click <strong>Add Attachments</strong>, the <strong class="bl">Content Browser</strong> appears in a pop-up window.</p>
</div>
<h2>The Content Browser</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>To upload files to your course, from the Content Browser, click the <strong>My Computer</strong> icon and browse your local computer for the files you need to upload. You can upload multiple files at once or individually.</p>

<p>Once uploaded, the files appear in your My Files folder. To attach the file, select it and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2>The HTML Creator &nbsp;<span class="g6">[previously HTML editor]</span></h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>The HTML Creator allows you to format files  in HTML. For example, you could use the HTML Creator to create the pages of a Web site assignment. If the HTML Creator is available within a tool, an <i>On/Off</i> toggle appears above the provided text box. If you select <i>"On</i>," the HTML Creator formatting tools appear in a tool box above the text box.</p>
