		The Chat   tool allows you, your classmates, and your instructor to engage in <strong>real time</strong> conversations with one another.  Your instructor will typically have you use the Chat  tool to engage in class discussions, much like you would in a regular classroom environment. You can use the Chat  tool to send text messages, create drawings, and share images.    </p>

<h2>Chat Rooms</h2>
<div class="m3x">
   Typically, your 
  instructor will create different "rooms" for different topics or themes; you and your classmates will enter the rooms to discuss the topic or theme. The Chat rooms in your online class are just like chat rooms on the Internet. Chat rooms 
  can be: 
  <ul>
<li><strong class="bl">combined chat/whiteboard</strong>, which allow you to exchange both text messages and images.</li>
<li><strong class="bl">chat</strong> only, which allow you to exchange text messages only.</li>
<li><strong class="bl">whiteboard</strong> only, which allow you to exchange images only.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Chat  Features</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>The Chat  tool also has the following features:</p>
    <ul>
<li>You may be allowed to send private messages to other participants.</li>
<li>You may have to "raise your hand" before you can participate in a chat or whiteboard session. In this case, your instructor will mediate the discussion.</li>
        <li>You may be able to view chat logs, allowing you to review the topics that were discussed.</li>
    </ul>
<p>If the Chat tool has been added to your course, it will appear under Course Tools. If you click the <strong>Chat</strong> icon, you are taken to the main screen for the Chat tool. Alternatively, your instructor may add a chat room to the Course Content Home, another folder, or the Action Menu of a learning module. If you click the chat room icon, you are taken to a screen that contains that specific chat room.</p>
 <p>Now, let's look at how to navigate the Chat  interface.</p>
