        <h2>The Course Content Home</h2>
        <div class="m3x">
            <p>When you first login to your Webcourses@UCF course, you are taken to the <strong class="bl">Course Content Home</strong>. <span class="gr">(This was previously referred to as the "homepage" and included a variety of buttons or icons.)</span> Like the homepage for a Web site, the Course Content Home is the main page for your course, as it provides an access point to the tools and content that have been added to the course.</p>
            <p class="c"><strong>The Course Content Home</strong><br /><img height="327" class="img_border" width="709" alt="The Course Content Home" src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/homepage.jpg" /></p>
            <p>The Course Content Home can contain a variety of icons; you can open the content that has been added to the Course Content Home by clicking an icon or link.</p>
            <p>Your instructor will organize the Course Content Home to match the objective of your online course. Course Content may be organized in folders and/or learning modules (formerly called Modules, Activities, Materials, Lessons, etc.). When you select the content link of a Learning Module, you will see a table of contents. By choosing the first link, you can access the course content.</p>
            
            <p>
				<img border="0" alt="Tip" src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/tip.gif" class="flt" />
				A quick way to return to the Course Content Home from anywhere in the course is to click the <strong>Course Content Home</strong> icon <img height="18" class="img_border" width="19" alt="Course Content Home Icon" src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/course_content_home_icon_small.jpg" />. The icon always appears in the top left-hand frame of any page in your online course.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Learning Modules</h2>
        <div class="m3x">
            <p>
				<span class="flt"><img height="68" class="img_border" width="73" alt="Learning module icon" src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/learning_module.jpg" /></span>
				Typically, your course will contain one or more <strong class="bl">learning modules</strong>. Learning modules are used to organize and deliver online course materials to you. (You're already somewhat familiar with learning modules, as this tutorial has been organized into a learning module!)
            </p>
            <p class="clb">When you open a learning module, there are two ways to navigate the learning module content: the <strong class="bl">Table of contents</strong> and the <strong class="bl">Previous Page</strong> and <strong class="bl">Next Page</strong> icons. If there is a table of contents, it will appear in the left-hand frame. You can navigate through the learning module by clicking the linked title of the page you want to go to. Alternatively, you can click the <strong class="bl">Previous Page</strong> <img height="13" class="img_border" width="13" alt="Previous Page icon" src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/previous.gif" /> and <strong class="bl">Next Page</strong> <img height="13" class="img_border" width="13" alt="Next Page icon" src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/next.gif" /> icons that appear in the top right-hand frame.</p>
            <p>Something new in online courses is the ability of your instructor to add content-related links directly to the Table of contents. This may include links to external Web sites, discussion activities, assignment drop box, quizzes, etc. You will no longer need to locate the individual tools as the learning modules will contain everything needed.</p>
            <p>Your instructor might also add content items, such as a related assignment or discussion topic, to the <strong>Action Menu</strong> of a learning module. The Action Menu appears at the top of each page in the learning module.</p>
            
            <p class="c"><strong>The Action Menu</strong><br /><img height="322" class="img_border" width="746" alt="The Action Menu" src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/action_menu.jpg" /></p>
            <p>Let's look at how you can access other tools from <strong class="bl">Course Tools</strong> and how you can navigate the course using the <strong class="bl">Breadcrumbs.</strong></p>
