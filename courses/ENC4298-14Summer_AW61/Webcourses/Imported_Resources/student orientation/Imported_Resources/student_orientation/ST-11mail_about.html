	Mail tool, formerly Course Mail, is another tool that facilitates communication between you, your instructor, and your classmates. You can use the Mail tool to send written messages to other users in your course. Using the Mail tool  to send messages is just like sending e-mail. However, unlike an external e-mail tool, you can only send messages to other members of your course; you cannot send messages over the Internet.
