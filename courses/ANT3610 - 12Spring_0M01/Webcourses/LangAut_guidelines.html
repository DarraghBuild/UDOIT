		<h1>Language Autobiography:<br>Grading Breakdown &amp; Writing Tips</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Grading Criteria (see also the Grading Form)</h2>
		<p><strong>Total Points: 100</strong></p>
		<p><em>1. Detailed &amp; insightful description of own linguistic interactions (40 points)</em></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Detailed description &#8211;the &#8220;what&#8221; of your experience/linguistic interactions (20 points).</li>
			<li>Insighfulness and your <em>connection</em> to the experience &#8211;the &#8220;why&#8221; of it (20 points).</li>

			<li>Appropriate/sufficient/correct reference to relevant authors, concepts, &amp; debates (24 points).</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>3. Organization of essay and quality of writing (8 points).</em></p>
		<ul>

		</ul>
		<p><em>4. Overall insightfulness of analysis (3 points)</em></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				How well are the following criteria met? 
				<ul>
					<li>Link autobiographical information (criteria 1) with course material (criteria 2).</li>
					<li>Quality/insightfulness of conclusions</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="bullet">Protocols</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Papers must be written in <strong>12-point font</strong>, <strong>double-spaced, 3-page maximum.</strong></li>
		</ol>
		<p><em>What a 3-page maximum means:</em> I will not penalize you if 
you need to go beyond three pages to complete a sentence or a paragraph.
 HOWEVER, if you write not one but several more paragraphs beyond the 
third page, you will lose points!!!!!</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Your paper must be submitted in TWO different places. When you 
click on the &#8220;Language Autobiography&#8221; link in the course content page of
 our webcourse, you will notice a link to an &#8220;Assignment&#8221; tool AND a 
link to Turnitin.com. You MUST submit your paper to BOTH tools. Please 
note that if you submit to one and not the other, you run the risk of 
getting a zero on the assignment.</li>
			<li>
				You must use <strong>proper citations</strong>. Although I do not 
need a Works Cited page (I already know who the authors are) I do need 
to see you properly cite your authors. For example:
				<ul>
					<li>Ahearn (Ch. 4) reminds us that the absence of a word in a language does not indicate&#8230;</li>
					<li>&#8230; for example, the way bedtime stories are read to the children of Roadville (Heath 2001)&#8230;</li>
					<li>&#8230; in contrast, my mother&#8217;s sie of the family has always enjoyed puns &amp; other wordplay (Jacobson&#8217;s poetic function)&#8230;</li>
					<li>As Kulik (1998) concludes, &#8220;language ideologies seem never to 
be solely about language &#8211;they are always entangled clusters of 
phenomena&#8221; (p100).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 class="bullet">Tips!!!!</h2>
		<p><em>Be concise:</em> Get to the point. Don&#8217;t try to use &#8220;big words&#8221; or over-explain your point. Less really is more!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>Bad</em>: In this formulation language&#8217;s influence on the 
thought process of an individual can be powerful, such that it becomes 
the sole determinant of the full spectrum of cognitive and perceptual 
abilities, baring any additional influence from the culture in which one
 is embedded.</li>
			<li><em>Good</em>: In this version, language determines thought, and neither thought nor culture affect language.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>Be explicit.</em> <strong></strong> If I have to search for the
 connection between your autobiographical event &amp; course material, I
 may have to assume it is not there.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>&#8220;Aspect A of my experience B relates to topic C in that it&#8230;&#8221;</li>
			<li>&#8220;Although one can argue that there is no difference in men&#8217;s and 
women&#8217;s speech, I believe that aspect X or my experience Y suggests 
otherwise because&#8230;&#8221;</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>Ask for help if you need it.</em> I am <em>always</em> happy to
 review and comment on drafts of papers before you hand them in. 
Students who hand their work in for review prior to the due date 
historically do much better on this assignment than those who wait until
 the due date to hand it in. The earlier you hand your draft in, the 
more carefully I can review it.</p>
