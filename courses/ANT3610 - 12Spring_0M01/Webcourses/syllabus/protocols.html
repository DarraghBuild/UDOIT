<h1>Protocols</h1>

<h2 class="bullet">Classroom Expectations</h2>
<p>The following ground rules will help your work in this course to go much more smoothly. Please carefully review these expectations and follow them.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Academic integrity will be       appraised according to the student academic behavior standards outlined in       <cite class="normal">The Golden Rule of the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s Student Handbook</cite>.       See <a href="http://www.goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/">http://www.goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu</a>/       for further details.</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t turn in late       assignments. Late submissions will result in a lower grade and will not be       accepted after three days.</li>
  <li>You have quite a few       chapters, modules, discussion postings, and e-mail messages to read for       the class. Please keep up with the reading. Students who keep up with the       reading tend to do much better in this kind of class than those who do       not.</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t miss a quiz. Missed       quizzes may not be retaken.</li>
  <li>Work with others. You are       required to make every effort to work effectively and promptly with others       in your groups. Fair criticism of your failure to work effectively with       others will significantly affect your collaboration and participation       grade.</li>
  <li>I do not like late arrivals       to class &ndash;it shows disrespect for your professor, your studies, and your       fellow classmates. I do realize, though, that sometimes lateness is       unavoidable. Students arriving more than 20 minutes late will not be admitted to class.</li>
  <li>Unless you have a documented       disability that has been documented through the University Disability       Services Office, you may not use laptops or tablets in class. </li>
  <li>You are responsible for all       material in videos presented in class. As such, it is your responsibility       to view videos on your own if you were unable to come to class. </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="bullet">E-mail</h2>
<p>E-mail will be an integral part of this course. All course-related e-mail  should be done through webcourses. Please do not e-mail me at my personal  e-mail address. Make sure you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check your Webcourses e-mail       at least three times a week (daily is better).</li>
  <li>Be patient. Don&rsquo;t expect an       immediate response when you send a message. Generally, three days is       considered reasonable amount of time to receive a reply. Also, I do not       check e-mail over the weekend.</li>
  <li>Include "Subject"       headings: use something that is descriptive and refer to a particular       assignment or topic.</li>
  <li>Be courteous and considerate.       Being honest and expressing yourself freely is very important but being       considerate of others online is just as important as in the classroom.</li>
  <li>Make every effort to be       clear. Online communication lacks the nonverbal cues that fill in much of       the meaning in face-to-face communication.</li>
  <li>Do not use all caps. This       makes the message very hard to read and is considered       "shouting." Check spelling, grammar, and punctuation (you may       want to compose in a word processor, then cut and paste the message into       the discussion or e-mail).</li>
  <li>Break up large blocks of text       into paragraphs and use a space between paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Sign your e-mail messages.</li>
  <li>Never assume that your e-mail       can be read by no one except yourself; others may be able to read or       access your mail. Never send or keep anything that you would not mind       seeing on the evening news.</li>
  <li>I will be posting relevant       course announcements, extra credit opportunities, and other information       via Twitter. My user name is @LangandCultUCF</li>
  <li>If you are unable to       physically come to office hours, I am available on Skype during office       hours. My Skype name is Dr_ReyesFoster. You may also reach me via instant       messaging on webcourses@ucf.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="bullet">Discussion Topics</h2>
<p>Many of the "rules of the road" or protocols that apply to e-mail also apply to the use of discussions.  Use the following conventions when composing a discussion posting:</p>
<ol>
	<li>During a Discussion assignment, deadlines for posting to and replying will be specified with each assignment. It is a good practice to always check the Discussions multiple times during the week.</li>
	<li>If you want to send a personal message to the instructor or to another student, use e-mail rather than the discussions (see above E-mail Protocols).</li>
	<li>Use the appropriate Discussion Topic; don&rsquo;t post everything on the "Main" Discussion Topic.</li>
	<li>Be patient. Don&rsquo;t expect an immediate response when you send a message.</li>
	<li>A helpful hint for use with both discussions and e-mail --- Compose your message in your word-processing application in order to check spelling, punctuation, and grammar --- then copy and paste your composition into e-mail or the discussion. This also saves online time.</li>
	<li>Everyone should feel free to participate in class and online discussions. Regular and meaningful discussion postings constitute a substantial portion of your grade.</li>
	<li>Respect each other&rsquo;s ideas, feelings and experience.</li>
	<li>Be courteous and considerate. It is important to be honest and to express yourself freely, but being considerate of others is just as important and expected online, as it is in the classroom.</li>
	<li>Explore disagreements and support assertions with data and evidence.</li>
	<li>"Subject" headings: use something that is descriptive and refer to a particular assignment or discussion topic when applicable. Some assignments will specify the subject heading.</li>
	<li>Use the "reply" button rather than the "compose" button if you are replying to someone else&rsquo;s posting.</li>
	<li>Do not use postings such as "I agree," "I don&rsquo;t know either," "Who cares," or "ditto." They do not add to the discussion, take up space on the Discussions, and will not be counted for assignment credit.</li>
	<li>Avoid posting large blocks of text. If you must, break them into paragraphs and use a space between paragraphs.</li>
	<li>Use the Technical Discussion topic for assistance with technical issues. Use the Help Discussion topic for questions about course material or assignments. There will be specific discussion topics for particular discussions - pay close attention to the assignment, and post appropriately.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="netiquette" class="bullet">Netiquette</h2>
<p>"Netiquette" has evolved to aid us in infusing our electronic communications with some of these missing behavioral pieces. "Emoticons" and other tools have become popular and I encourage their use when it will add to the clarity of your communication.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>:-)</dt><dd>happy, pleased</dd>
	<dt>:-( </dt><dd>sad, displeased</dd>
	<dt>:-O </dt><dd>surprised</dd>
	<dt>&gt;:-| </dt><dd>angry</dd>
</dl>

<p>Abbreviate when possible.  Examples:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>LOL</dt> <dd>laugh out loud, "I find this funny"</dd>
	<dt>ROFL</dt> <dd>rolling on floor laughing, really funny</dd>
	<dt>BTW</dt> <dd>by the way</dd>
	<dt>*grin*</dt> <dd>smiling</dd>
	<dt>IMHO</dt> <dd>in my humble opinion</dd>
	<dt>FYI</dt> <dd>for your info</dd>
	<dt>Flame</dt> <dd>antagonistic criticism</dd>
</dl>

<p>Netiquette continues to evolve and I am sure that we will have constant additions to this growing language. The important thing to remember is that all of the "cute" symbols in the world cannot replace your careful choice of words and "tone" in your communication.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Netiquette and electronic communication by visiting <a href="http://learn.ucf.edu/">Learning Online</a>.</p>

<h2 id="viruses" class="bullet">Viruses</h2>
<p>A virus can spell disaster. Your use of a reputable anti-virus program is a requirement for participation in this course (good ones include McAfee or Norton).</p>
<p>Also, back up your files: "My hard drive crashed." "My modem doesn&rsquo;t work." "My printer is out of ink." These are today&rsquo;s equivalents of "My dog ate my homework." And these events really do occur and they are really inconvenient when they do. However, these are not valid excuses for failing to get your work in on time.</p>
