<h2 class="bullet">Course Description</h2>
<p>The  main goal of this course is to provide you with a basic understanding of  various anthropological approaches to the study of language. You will learn how  language both reflects and shapes thought, culture, and power.  Please be prepared to actively engage with  course readings and discussions, and be prepared to apply what you are learning  to your own experiences with language in everyday settings. This is a mixed mode (M) course. This means that approximately 50% of your learning will take place online. Please be aware that you are required to complete all online work in order to pass this class. </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Course Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Recall and explain basic terminology used in anthropological  linguistics.</li>
  <li>Identify and discern key information from reading materials. </li>
  <li>Assess how the broader concepts covered in this class can be used  to understand everyday speech interactions. </li>
</ul>

Late assignments (including  grading discussions) will be penalized one point a day for up to three days. I  will not accept late assignments after this grace period. </p>
<p>Occasionally, I  will broadcast an extra credit opportunity via social networking and webcourse  announcements. I do not accept any late extra credit assignments.</p>

<h2 class="bullet">Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>You are required to attend all face-to-face class meetings.  We cover a lot of material in class, all of it potentially appearing on the  exams, so missing any class session can be costly. I will also be showing films  during our face-to-face classes that you will not have access to online. </p>
<p>I do not like late arrivals to class &ndash; it shows disrespect  for your professor, your studies, and your fellow classmates. I do realize,  though, that sometimes lateness is unavoidable. Students arriving more than 20 minutes late to class will not be admitted</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>Plagiarism and  Cheating of any kind on an examination, quiz, or assignment will result at  least in an "F" for that assignment (and may, depending on the  severity of the case, lead to an "F" for the entire course) and may  be subject to appropriate referral to the Office of Student Conduct for further  action. See the <a href="http://www.goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu"><cite class="normal">UCF Golden  Rule</cite></a> for further  information. I will assume for this course that you will adhere to the academic  creed of this University and will maintain the highest standards of academic  integrity. In other words, don't cheat by giving answers to others or taking  them from anyone else. I will also adhere to the highest standards of academic  integrity, so please do not ask me to change (or expect me to change) your  grade illegitimately or to bend or break rules for one person that will not  apply to everyone.</p>
<p>In this course we will utilize turnitin.com, an automated  system which instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student's  assignment with billions of web sites, as well as an enormous database of  student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be  expected to submit all assignments in electronic format to both the assignments  dropbox on webcourses@ucf and <a href="http://www.turnitin.com/">turnitin.com</a>. After the assignment is processed,  as an instructor I receive a report from turnitin.com that states if and how  another author&rsquo;s work was used in the assignment. For a more detailed look at  this process, visit <a href="http://www.turnitin.com/">http://www.turnitin.com</a>.</p>

<h2 class="bullet">Third-Party Software and FERPA</h2>
<p>During this course you  might have the opportunity to use public online services and/or software  applications sometimes called third-party software such as a blog or wiki.  While some of these could be required assignments, you need <strong>not</strong> make any personally identifying  information on a public site. Do not post or provide any private information  about yourself or your classmates. Where appropriate you may use a pseudonym or  nickname. Some written assignments posted publicly may require personal  reflection/comments, but the assignments will not require you to disclose any personally  identity-sensitive information. If you have any concerns about this, please  contact your instructor.</p>
