		<h1>Module 7: Literacy Practices</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
		<p>In our society, the ability to read and write is a basic necessity.
 As we move into the &#8220;digital age,&#8221; literacy is rapidly becoming 
indispensible to our functioning as members of society. However, <strong>literacy</strong>,
 like all linguistic phenomena, is not a neutral activity nor simply a 
means to an end, but is socially charged. This week, we will learn about
 how linguistic anthropologists study literacy as a socially situated 
practice. In our reading, we will consider <strong>love letter writing in Nepal</strong>, <strong>instant messaging</strong>, and <strong>preschool literacy</strong> as ethnographic examples of research conducted by linguistic anthropologists on literacy.</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
		<p>At the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Summarize the ways in which the study of literacy has been approach.</li>
			<li>Explain the difference between a <strong>literacy event</strong> and <strong>literacy practices</strong>.</li>
			<li>Apply the concepts learned to specific ethnographic examples in the textbook and supplementary readings.</li>
		</ul>
