		<h1>Module 12: Assignment</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Assignment Overview</h2>
		<p>This week&#8217;s assignment is:</p>
		<p>Complete the graded group discussion</p>
		<p>Complete Online Quiz 6 <strong>(available Friday, April 20-Monday, April 23)</strong></p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Instructions</h2>
		<p>Complete the assigned readings for this week.</p>
		<p>Again, this week&#8217;s assigned readings are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ahearn, Laura. 2012. Living Language. Ch. 12</li>
			<li>Monaghan, Leila. 2011. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1433.2011.01326.x/pdf">The Expanding Boundaries of Linguistic Anthropology: 2010 in Perspective</a>. American Anthropologist: 222-234.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In your small group discussion board, post an original, thoughtful 
reflection how far you have come since the beginning of the semester. 
Reflect on the readings introduced this week and write your impressions 
about linguistic anthropology. This is the final discussion of the 
semester, so I really want to see you reflect on our short intellectual 
journey. Do you feel that you are better off for it? Was there anything 
particularly interesting that you would have liked to go into more 
deeply?</p>
		<p><em>Your original post must be in the discussion board by</em> <strong>midnight</strong> <em>on</em> <strong>Wednesday</strong>. Subsequently, you must also respond to someone else&#8217;s post in a thoughtful, provocative manner. <em>Your response must be posted by</em> <strong>midnight</strong> <em>on</em> <strong>Friday</strong>.  Please be sure to respect our netiquette and write clearly, concisely, and correctly.</p>
