		<h1>Module 12: Language, Power, and Agency</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Before you read</h2>
		<p>You may be surprised that the final chapter of our book contains SO much new material. In this module, I will be expanding and clarifying some of the concepts introduced in chapter 12 &#8211;some of which can be quite challenging. The reason that Ahearn introduces these concepts as she closes the book is to get you to think about how linguistic anthropology fits more broadly within general anthropological theory &#8211;and to whet your appetite for the kind of concepts you might run into should you wish to continue your studies in this field. As you read, think about how the material we have learned this semester serves to illustrate the concepts introduced in this final chapter.</p>
		<p>As you read this module, think about the four key terms that Ahearn lays out in the beginning of the semester: <strong>multifunctionality</strong>, <strong>language ideologies</strong>, <strong>practice</strong>, and <strong>indexicality</strong>. How does each of these concepts relate to the final theories introduced at the end of this course?</p>
		<p>Remember, items that have been <strong>bolded</strong> may appear in quizzes and exams!</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Focus points</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Gramsci&#8217;s writing on <strong>hegemony</strong>.</li>
			<li>Foucault&#8217;s writing on <strong>power relations</strong> and <strong>governmentality.</strong></li>
			<li>Boudieu&#8217;s writing on <strong>hexis</strong> and its relationship to <strong>habitus</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Doxa, orthodoxy,</strong> and <strong>heterodoxy</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="bullet">Power</h2>
		<p><strong>Power</strong> is a BIG concept that can mean many, many different things. However, it is highly salient in anthropology today and can be extremely useful in thinking about <strong>language as social action</strong>. In the book and module, we will be focusing on <strong>three approaches to power</strong> in anthropological theory:</p>
		<p>1. The concept of <strong>hegemony</strong>.</p>
		<p>2. <strong>Power and discourse</strong>.</p>
		<p>3. <strong>Practice, habitus,</strong> and <strong>doxa</strong>.</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Gramsci&#8217;s notion of Hegemony</h2>
		<p>
			Italian philosopher and journalist Antonio Gramsci first talked about the idea of hegemony in his <em>Prison Notebooks</em>, a collection of papers he wrote while imprisoned by Mussolini for his political beliefs in from the late 1920s until his death in 1937. <strong>Hegemony</strong> explains why societies remain stable  despite the fact that some members of society are clearly advantaged over others. For Gramsci, the key to <strong>social control</strong> lies in <strong>dominance</strong> not only over the means of production but
			(more importantly) <strong>over political, cultural, and institutional influence.</strong> </p>
		<p><img alt="Black and white sketch of Antonio Gramsci." height="333" src="image1.e083a.jpg" width="250" class="flt"/></p>
		<p>Because Gramsci was writing about social control and domination in Benito Mussolini&#8217;s Italy, it is hardly surprising that most of his theories about hegemony center on <strong>state control of social institutions</strong>. <strong>Raymond Williams</strong> built on Gramsci&#8217;s work and introduced the idea of <strong>hegemony as a form of culture</strong>. For Williams, hegemony refers to doing things simply because &#8220;this is how things are done.&#8221; It refers to <strong>notions, ideas,</strong> and <strong>values</strong> that are <strong>taken for granted</strong> and for the most part <strong>invisible</strong>.</p>
		<p>For example, think about what we consider to be &#8220;correct&#8221; forms of grammar and writing. Why are these particular styles &#8220;more correct&#8221; than others? Who decides what is or is not &#8220;grammatically correct&#8221; and why do they have authority to make these calls?</p>
		<h2 class="bullet" style="clear:both;">Foucault on Power and Discourse</h2>
		<p>For French theorist <strong>Michel Foucault</strong>, power is not something that is <strong>owned</strong> or <strong>possessed</strong>, but rather, something that is <strong>relational</strong> and <strong>expressed in social relationships.</strong> The idea here is that <strong>power operates through governance</strong>. Broadly speaking, <strong>governance</strong> does NOT refer to governance by the state (i.e., government in the traditional way), although it does include it. In this sense, governance refers to <strong>society structures that limit a person&#8217;s field of possible actions</strong>. So, for example, the field of possible actions of a person born in inner-city Oakland will be different than those of a person born in the wealthy North Berkeley neighborhood located only a few miles down the road.  Over time, these <strong>power relations</strong> can result in <strong>dominance. Institutions, procedures,</strong> and <strong>knowledge</strong> come together in individuals to form what Foucault terms <strong>governmentality</strong>, a word that is meant to combine <strong>govern</strong> with <strong>mentality</strong>, which is the way in which people become disposed to being governed by these institutions, procedures, and knowledge.</p>
		<p>In linguistic anthropology, Foucault&#8217;s <strong>theory of power</strong> can be studied through the production and exchange of <strong>signs</strong> (remember <strong>indexicality</strong>?). That is, power relations are embedded within everyday social and linguistic interactions. Think about, for example, whether you interact differently with a police officer that has pulled you over for speeding than you do when you&#8217;re hanging out with your friends. In what ways does a police officer have the ability to limit your possibilities of action? How does this translate into your behavior around him or her?</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Agency and Bourdieu&#8217;s Practice Theory</h2>
		<p>Take some time and carefully read pages <strong>265-272</strong>. In this section, I&#8217;m going to tease out some of the major concepts brought up by Ahearn &#8211;Practice theory is extremely complex and Ahearn is a renowned practice theorist, so she spends quite a bit of time unraveling Bourdieu&#8217;s approach to practice and its implications for agency &#8211; <strong>the socially-mediated capacity to act</strong>. Remember <strong>habitus</strong>? It refers to the kind of embodied knowledge people acquire very early in childhood &#8211;like a piano player&#8217;s fingers instinctively &#8220;knowing&#8221; the location of the keys, habitus is our way of instinctively &#8220;knowing&#8221; how to dress, speak, or walk.</p>
		<h3>Bodily Hexis</h3>
		<p>
			Ahearn builds on the concept of <strong>habitus</strong> by introducing Bourdieu&#8217;s notion of <strong>bodily hexis</strong>, a habitual nonverbal behavior that communicates value judgments about &#8220;appropriate&#8221; dress, bearing, manners, or posture. Check out this video featuring <a href="http://youtu.be/k5PwwLBFrUI">Howard 
				Wolowitz</a> from the CBS show <em>The Big Band Theory</em>. In particular, pay attention to the women that are often the focus of his unsuccessful attempts to engage with them.  Can you identify anything in their body language that suggests judgment? <strong>Hexis</strong> is all about the ways in which our bodily behavior indexes our social background and class. In this scene, from the classic film <a href="http://youtu.be/pJvOyDlcHzs">My Fair Lady</a>, Henry, a linguist, is trying to pass off Eliza Doolittle, a common flower-girl, as a woman of high society. Although he has taught her to speak properly, her speech and, ultimately, body language, betray her background. This is what Ahearn means when she says that &#8220;once a particular bodily hexis is internalized, it can be very difficult to unlearn.&#8221; Eliza&#8217;s <strong>hexis</strong> indexes her as an uneducated woman of the London streets. In real life, her life prospects would have been limited at best. 
		</p>
		<h3>Doxa</h3>
		<p>Another concept of Bourdieu&#8217;s that is key to understanding practice theory &#8211;and to thinking about social inequality&#8212;is the notion of <strong>doxa.</strong></p>
        <p><img alt="Visual representation of Bourdieu's &quot;doxic universe&quot; (my term). This image is almost identical to that found in page 269 of your book." height="305" src="image2.c090f.jpg" width="343"/ class="flt"></p>
		<p><strong>Doxa</strong> refers to all norms and cultural values that are <strong>unspoken</strong> and <strong>taken for granted</strong>. Like <strong>hegemony</strong>, <strong>doxa</strong> is that which is simply <strong>&#8220;common sense&#8221;</strong>: people do not debate <strong>doxa</strong> because it does not occur to them that there could be any other way of thinking or acting.  In this sense, <strong>doxa</strong> is the <strong>universe of the undiscussed</strong> and <strong>undisputed</strong>.</p>
		<p>When an idea finds its way <strong>out of doxa</strong>, it becomes an opinion that can agreed or disagreed with. <strong>Orthodoxy</strong> refers to ideas in <strong>discourse</strong> that <strong>support</strong> the status quo and thus reject the idea, <strong>heterodoxy</strong> refers to ideas in discourse that <strong>reject</strong> the status quo and thus embrace the idea. The example given by Ahearn in the book is perfect for understanding this: In public discourse in the United States, it used to be part of <strong>doxa</strong> that marriage was <strong>by definition</strong> a union between a man and a woman.  This was something so taken-for-granted that it did not need to be discussed. Now, that assumption has come to be challenged, and the idea of gay marriage has entered the <strong>universe of discourse</strong> and <strong>opinion</strong>, with people expressing either <strong>orthodox</strong> or <strong>heterodox</strong> opinions on the subject.</p>
		<h3>Symbolic Capital and Profit of Distinction</h3>
		<p>People who are able to speak in highly valued ways have what Bourdieu calls <strong>symbolic capital. Symbolic capital</strong> refers to many things besides accent &#8211;it means having the &#8220;right&#8221; kind of habitus, education, skin tone, financial capital, last name, sense of style&#8230; in short, <strong>symbolic capital</strong> is what allows some people to be &#8220;naturally successful.&#8221;  Having the right kind of <strong>symbolic capital</strong> enables one to gain a <strong>profit of distinction</strong> in what Bourdieu calls <strong>the linguistic market,</strong> a concept not unlike Bakhtin&#8217;s <strong>heteroglossia</strong> &#8211;the way in which languages circulate in society. In other words, speaking in socially valued ways (like wearing the right sorts of clothes and carrying oneself with the right kind of demeanor) opens doors and makes social and financial success easier to attain.</p>
		<p>A final concept you should familiarize yourself with is that of <strong>misrecognition</strong>, the acceptance of social values other than one&#8217;s own as &#8220;better&#8221; because they are associated with higher symbolic capital. A good example of this is when Maya parents choose not to teach their children to speak Mayan because Spanish is understood to be the language of success.</p>
