	<h1>Module 12: Language, Power, and Agency</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the final module of the semester!!!! This module is all 
about looking forward: you will learn some challenging concepts such as <strong>Bourdieu&#8217;s practice theory</strong> and <strong>Foucault&#8217;s</strong> take on <strong>power</strong> and <strong>discourse</strong>.
 These are concepts that are salient not only in linguistic 
anthropology, but in anthropology in general. These theories integrate 
linguistic anthropology into the broader field of general anthropology 
and give you a sense of where the field is headed right now. In the 
spirit of exposing you to the more cutting-edge side of linguistic 
anthropology, I also assigned <strong>Leila Monaghan&#8217;s</strong> article &#8220;The Expanding Boundaries of Linguistic Anthropology: 2010 in Perspective.&#8221;</p>
		<p>I really hope that you have enjoyed taking this class as much as I 
have enjoyed teaching it. This was the first time I have taught the 
course in mixed mode, so I apologize for any kinds of glitches that may 
be happened a result. I always love getting feedback because it gives me
 the ability to improve my teaching in future classes. I do hope that I 
see some of you again.</p>
		<p>Please feel free to contact me if you ever feel so inclined. It has
 been a real pleasure getting to know you as my students. Have an 
amazing break and a wonderful, successful career at UCF.</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
		<p>At the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>List the major theories of power and their corresponding theorists.</li>
			<li>Summarize the variety of ways in which Linguistic anthropology is changing and expanding (cf. Leila Monaghan&#8217;s article).</li>
			<li>Explain Ahearn&#8217;s approach to power (how she brings these theories together).</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="bullet">Time Management</h2>
		<p>This course is designed to maximize benefits gained from our weekly
 f2f meeting. In order for our class meeting to enhance and further 
deepen your understanding of course materials and help you achieve our 
module objectives, I suggest you manage your time wisely. An efficient 
example of how you can best utilize your time for this course is as
