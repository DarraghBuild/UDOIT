<h1>Module 11: Endangered Languages</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the next to last module of the semester! This  module is extremely important and interesting, but you will also find it a lot  less challenging in terms of reading load than the last two. Moreover, this  module will be extended over two weeks, with no graded discussion component in  the first week. In this module we will learn about language extinction, its  reasons, mechanisms, and circumstances, as well as language revitalization  movements and the ways in which some languages can and have been brought back  from the brink of extinction. You will also learn about why linguistic  anthropologists place so much importance on the negative aspects of language  extinction, despite the fact that language extinction is an extremely common  occurrence. </p>

<p>  As you complete this module, do the readings, and watch the  film <strong><cite>The  Linguists</cite></strong>, think about the  role <strong>power asymmetries</strong> play in the  disappearance of languages and the possibilities of <strong>agency</strong> in everyday life (more on this in <strong>Module 12</strong>...)</p>

<h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List examples of disappearing languages. </li>
  <li>Identify the criteria for classifying languages as safe,       extinct, or somewhere in between.</li>
  <li>Identify the mechanisms by which languages become       extinct.</li>
  <li>Explain the position of linguistic anthropologists       regarding the extinction of languages.</li>
  <li>Identify language revitalization movements. </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bullet">Time Management</h2>
<p>This course is designed to maximize benefits gained from our  weekly f2f meeting. In order for our class meeting to enhance and further  deepen your understanding of course materials and help you achieve our module  objectives, I suggest you manage your time wisely. An efficient example of how  you can best utilize your time for this course is as follows:</p>
