<h1>Module 3: Language Acquisition and  Socialization</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Before you Read</h2>
<p>Have you ever spent time with a toddler? Lately, my two-year-old has  been attempting to put me in time out when I do things he doesn&rsquo;t approve of. He  has also been commanding our cat to <em>&ldquo;&iexcl;B&aacute;jate!&rdquo;</em> (get off) the kitchen table. He is quickly discovering that having the ability  to verbalize a command he has long understood does not translate into the  ability to effectively carry out the command. As he acquires the ability to  speak, he is also beginning to understand more about his place in the world as  a member of his family and of society. The vast majority of human beings are  born with the ability to acquire language, and go through a process of language  acquisition and socialization. </p>
<p>In this module, we will be learning more about this process, focusing  specifically on the ways in which <em>the  process of acquiring a language is affected by the process of becoming a  competent member of society AND how the process of becoming a competent member  of society is realized to a large extent through language</em> (Ochs and  Schieffelin 2001, cited in Ahearn 2012). Simply put, we learn language through  socialization, and we become socialized through language. In addition, we will  be using the concepts learned in our textbook to read an ethnography: Keith  Basso&rsquo;s classic book, <cite>Portraits of the  Whiteman</cite>. As you read the first two chapters of this book, think about the  way in which language socialization becomes evident in the examples provided. </p>
<p>Remember, terms that have been <strong>emphasized </strong>require special attention and should appear in  assessments such as our graded group discussions, or in tests or quizzes. The  supplementary materials in this module are meant to better illustrate the  concepts and ideas discussed in the reading. Also, please note that items that  are <a href="http://anthropology.cos.ucf.edu/content/index.html">hyperlinked</a> are connected to interesting audio or video supplementary materials. </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Focus Points</h2>
<p>As you read, you should pay special attention to the  following themes, concepts, and issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the relationship between learning how to speak       and learning how to act?</li>
  <li>What is the impact of <strong>multilingualism</strong> in language acquisition?</li>
  <li>Linguistic anthropologists conceptualize language       acquisition as <strong>socially mediated.</strong></li>
  <li>Language socialization is also embedded in broader       structures of <strong>power</strong>.</li>
  <li>How are <strong>language       ideologies</strong> transmitted at the same time as language itself?</li>
  <li>How is language socialization a <strong>lifelong process?</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bullet">Language Socialization: Katie and Bage</h2>
<p>Ch. 3 of our textbook begins with a description of two babies  being raised in two very different places: Katie, an American three-month-old  growing up in a middle-class family in the United States, and Bage, a three  month-month-old Kaluli boy growing up in Papua New Guinea. Ahearn identifies  two phenomena present in American caregiving that are absent in Papua New  Guinea: <a href="http://youtu.be/GltHZ_pEf6o">&ldquo;self-lowering,&rdquo;</a> when a parent  simplify their speech or bring themselves down to what they perceive is the  infant&rsquo;s level of understanding, and <a href="http://youtu.be/lmEKMkBM2T8">&ldquo;child raising,&rdquo;</a> that is, treating the child  as more competent linguistically than she really is. By contrast, in Papua New  Guinea, young children are never directly addressed and are expected to adapt  themselves to specific situations rather than the other way around. Video of  Papua New Guinean parenting isn&rsquo;t as easy to find on You Tube as that of  Americans, but this brief clip from the movie <a href="http://youtu.be/5IkoPUAijXs"><cite>Babies</cite></a> illustrates  some of the differences between the way infants and toddlers are socialized in  the United States and in non-western societies such as Namibia, Mongolia, and  Japan. I also found this fascinating <a href="http://youtu.be/4vjiW_vLuxs">clip</a> from Margaret Mead of the first  minutes of a Papua New Guinean baby&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>
  What sorts of people might Katie and Bage grow up to become?  How will their worldview be affected by how they&rsquo;re socialized into their  respective societies? And, most relevant to our class, how does the process of  language acquisition intersect with the culturally and linguistically specific  factors in every person&rsquo;s upbringing?</p>

<h2 class="bullet">Language Acquisition and the Socialization Process</h2>
<h3>Chomsky on Language Acquisition</h3>
<p>As you have  read, Noam Chomsky, one of the most influential linguists of our time, has  stated that environment has a very minor role in the language acquisition  process. For Chomsky and his followers, the Universal Grammar (UG) hardwired  into the brain of every human being provides the template needed for learning  human language. </p>
  <p>Some  linguists, cognitive scientists, and child development specialists disagree  with the Chomskyan view, however. In particular, sociolinguists and linguistic  anthropologists take issue to Chomsky&rsquo;s claim that a young child&rsquo;s exposure to  language is &ldquo;restricted,&rdquo; and argue that most children are exposed to  sufficient linguistic input that they may acquire language without the  hard-wiring of a UG. </p>
 <p> Central for Linguistic anthropologists is the fact that  language acquisition does not occur in a cultural vacuum. Children are not  simply learning a language, they are learning about what constitutes acceptable  behavior in their societies. Remember my anecdote about my toddler? He is not only  learning how to speak, he is also learning that some behavior results in  negative consequences (a time out) and that he does not have the authority to  give others a time out, but he does have the authority to tell the family cat  to get off the kitchen table. All of this information is codified in language  and is impossible to separate from language. In other words:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>The process of acquiring language is deeply affected by  the process of becoming a competent member of society. AND</li>
 <li>The process of becoming a competent member of society is  realized to a large extent through language. </li>
 </ol>
<h3>Do all children  learn grammar the same way?</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Grammar&rdquo; does not refer to the set of rules you learned  about in grade school. Rather, grammar refers to the specific ways in which  particular languages behave: If a language uses a form of the verb &ldquo;to be,&rdquo; for  example, or a specific word to indicate possession by a single person and  another by several people (&ldquo;mine vs. ours&rdquo;). Toddlers often make certain kinds  of grammatical mistakes with regularity &ndash;speaking in the third person, using  &ldquo;me&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;my&rdquo;, and confusing the second person singular, saying &ldquo;you&rdquo;  when they mean &ldquo;me.&rdquo; Please read pages 54-56 of your textbook very carefully  and consider Ahearn&rsquo;s discussion of Elinor Och&rsquo;s research in Western Samoa,  where she discovered that children learn different grammatical features of  their language at different times than children who spoke other  similarly-structured languages and English. </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Language Acquisition in Bilingual or Multilingual Contexts</h2>
<p>Studying children growing up in bilingual contexts is highly  revelatory of both the language acquisition process and the social factors and  language ideologies that are embedded in multilingual contexts. In pages 56-60,  Ahearn presents the example of Taiap and Tok Pisin, two languages spoken in  Gapun, Papua New Guinea. Why is one of these languages disappearing? What is  the local explanation for the disappearance of the language, and what has  linguistic anthropological research uncovered?</p>
<p>Taiap and Tok Pisin are two languages embedded in a social  context that is mediated by power differences. If you have not done so already,  turn now to Chapter 1 of Keith Basso&rsquo;s book, <cite>Portraits of &ldquo;The Whiteman.&rdquo;</cite> Pay special attention to Basso&rsquo;s  description of a little girl play-scolding her puppy using the language of &ldquo;the  whiteman.&rdquo; How does this passage reflect language socialization? How does  Apache joking reflect particular types of language ideologies and power  relations?</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Language Socialization throughout the Lifespan</h2>
<p>Although we have spent most of this module discussing  language socialization among children, it is important to remember that  language socialization is a process that continuous throughout one&rsquo;s life. In  your textbook, Ahearn presents the example of how law school students are  socialized into becoming lawyers. In what ways have you come to be socialized  into a new way of speaking or thinking in your life?</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The material presented in this module  is not exhaustive; it is meant to function as a guide to our course materials.  Concepts, key terms, and ethnographic examples that appear in our readings or  that are discussed in future f2f classes can and will be used in assessments  even if they are not specifically mentioned in this course module. </p>
