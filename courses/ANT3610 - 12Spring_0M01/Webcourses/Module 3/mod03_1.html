 <h1 align="center">Module 3: Language Acquisition and  Socialization</h1>
 <h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
 <p>This week, we  are moving away from concepts and theory in Linguistic anthropology towards  considering the ways in which Language is socially enacted. In the beginning of  Ch. 3 in your textbook, Ahearn presents two examples of how young children are  socialized in societies in the United States and Papua New Guinea. In this  module, we will consider language acquisition and the ways in which young  children are socialized through and into language. As an example both of  language socialization and the ways in which language can reflect language  ideologies, we will begin our reading of Keith Basso&rsquo;s book, <cite>Portraits of the Whiteman.</cite></p>
 <h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
 <p>At the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Describe the language socialization process.</li>
   <li>Summarize Noam Chomsky&rsquo;s theory of Universal Grammar       and language acquisition.</li>
   <li>Explain linguistic anthropological explanation of       socially situated language acquisition.</li>
   <li>Apply knowledge gained about language acquisition to an       ethnographic example.</li>
   <li>Identify how Apache children reproduce their social       realities through joking.</li>
 </ul>
