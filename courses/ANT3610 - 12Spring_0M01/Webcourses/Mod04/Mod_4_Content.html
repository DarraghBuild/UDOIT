<h1>Module 4: Supplementary Material</h1>

<h2 class="bullet">Before You Read</h2>
<p>Start this module by listening to the following <a href="http://www.theworld.org/2011/10/future-tense-language/">podcast</a> about  Yale Economist Keith Chen, who recently conducted a study of languages around  the world and concluded that people save more or less according to the language  they speak.</p>

  <p>In this module, you have two assigned readings. Our first  reading, from our textbook, deals with the history of <strong>linguistic relativity</strong>: the idea that language and thought are  intimately connected and that both can and do influence each other.  Central to our understanding of the  relationship between language, thought, and culture is the so-called <strong>Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis</strong>, an  often-misunderstood axiom of linguistic relativity.  As you read, pay special attention to the  debates surrounding the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and be sure to have a clear  understanding of how anthropologists today seek to understand the connections  between language, thought, and culture.  Subsequently, the author considers recent  research investigating the effects of language on thought through experimental  methods. Citing the work of John Lucy, Ahearn identifies three areas of  investigation: <strong>language-in-general, linguistic structures</strong>, and <strong>language use</strong>.  In this last section, Ahearn references our  other assigned reading for this week: Carol Cohn&rsquo;s article <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3174209"><cite class="normal">Sex and Death in the Rational World  of Defense Intellectuals</cite></a>.  I suggest  you go back and re-read Ahearn&rsquo;s discussion of Cohn&rsquo;s thesis (Ahearn pgs.  93-94) after you read Cohn&rsquo;s article. How does your understanding of Cohn&rsquo;s  argument contrast with Ahearn&rsquo;s?</p>
  
  <p>Remember, terms that have been <strong>emphasized </strong>require special attention and should appear in  assessments such as our graded group discussions, or in tests or quizzes. The  supplementary materials in this module are meant to better illustrate the  concepts and ideas discussed in the reading. </p>
  
<h2 class="bullet">Focus Points</h2>
<p>As you read, you must pay special attention to the following  themes, concepts, and issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who are the intellectual founders of linguistic  anthropology? What did they study? What did they conclude?</li>
  <li>What is the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis? What is it  not? What is an <strong>axiomatic</strong> view?</li>
  <li>How have the effects of language on thought been  investigated? Be able to list and describe all three of Lucy&rsquo;s &ldquo;broad areas&rdquo; of  research.</li>
  <li>What are <strong>semantic  domains </strong>vs. <strong>grammatical categories</strong>?  How have they been studied by linguists and linguistic anthropologists? Provide  specific examples. </li>
  <li>How does Cohn&rsquo;s article present an interesting  example of the relationship between language and thought through <strong>language use</strong>? </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bullet">Historical Figures</h2>
<p>Make sure you are familiar with each of these important  figures in anthropological history, their ideas about language and thought, and  how they knew each other. </p>

<h2 class="bullet clear">The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis </h2>
        <p><strong>The Axiomatic View of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis</strong></p>
          <p>Many researchers outside of  anthropology have mistakenly used the term &ldquo;Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis&rdquo; to mean the  simplistic notion that language determines thought. The idea that the  Sapir-Whorf hypothesis runs in one direction, from language to thought, without  any consideration for culture is simply incorrect. It is important to note that  the term &ldquo;Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis&rdquo; itself is a misnomer because: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sapir and Whorf never  co-authored a text together.</li>
          <li>The &ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo; does  not satisfy the scientific requirements of a hypothesis in that is not falsifiable  nor testable. In fact, Boas, Sapir, and Whorf never framed their research on  language using the language of science.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Today, linguistic anthropologists  prefer to take an <strong>axiomatic </strong>view of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, where  language, thought, and culture are all mutually constitutive. An <strong>axiom</strong> is an assumption that informs all research, in other words, a statement or  proposition that is accepted and taken for granted.</p>
        
<div class="c"><img class="padright" src="images/mistakenwhorf.jpg" alt='This graphic displays the mistaken understanding of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The word "language" appears on the left with an arrow pointing to the word "thought", indicating the simplistic notion that language determines thought.' />    <img src="images/axiomaticwhorf.jpg" alt='This graphic displays the axiomatic view of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. The words, "language", "thought", and "culture" are arranged in a triangle formation, with arrows pointing to and from each word. This indicates the view that language, thought and culture are mutually constitutive.' /></div>
        
<h2 class="bullet clear">Theory of Mind and Language in General</h2>
<h3>False-Belief Tests </h3>

<p>As you read in your textbook, linguists, psychologists, and  linguistic anthropologists often look to children when they want to learn  something about language. This is because young children are in the process of  learning language, so observing how young children acquire language &ndash;how their  abilities and perceptions about the world shift as language becomes an  increasingly important filter through which they see the world&mdash;can tell us a  lot about the nature of language itself <em>and </em>the relationship between language and  thought.</p>

<p>A key concept in developmental psychology is <strong>theory of mind</strong>, our ability to read  intent, emotions, and actions in others. It is central to our ability to  empathize with others and to the development of our social skills.  A false-belief test is a test devised to  determine whether or not a child has developed theory of mind. This <a href="http://watchevansville.com/play/Education%20and%20Schools/The_False_Belief_Test_Theory_of_Mind">video</a> shows a great example of a False-Belief test. </p>

  <h2 class="bullet">In Conclusion&hellip;</h2>
  
  <p>Listen to the <a href="http://www.theworld.org/2011/10/future-tense-language/">podcast</a> about  Yale economist Chen again. Has the material we have covered made you think  about this report in a new way?</p>

<h2 class="bullet">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The material presented in this module is not exhaustive; it  is meant to function as a guide to our course materials. Concepts, key terms,  and ethnographic examples that appear in our readings or that are discussed in  class can and will be used in assessments even if they are not specifically  mentioned in this course module. This module in no way is meant to substitute  our readings or f2f classes.</p>
