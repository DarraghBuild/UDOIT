		<h1>Module 4: Language, Thought, and Culture</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
		<p>What is the relationship between language and thought? How does culture influence &#8211;and how is culture influenced by&#8212;language? Think about how your own upbringing has endowed you with a specific language(s) and worldview.  Now, think about the example of the two Maya men greeting each other in the course introduction.  What can language tell us about worldview? Can you have a worldview without a corresponding language for it? In this chapter, we will learn the history of this debate in the field of anthropological linguistics, and consider some compelling research that has been carried out on these questions.</p>
