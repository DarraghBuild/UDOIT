<h1>Course Introduction</h1>
<p>Not that long ago, when I was a college sophomore at Rutgers  University in New Jersey, my major advisor told me that in order to major in  anthropology I had to take a course in &ldquo;ling anth&rdquo;, or linguistic anthropology.  I must admit that at first, I felt really overwhelmed. The little bit that I  had heard about what linguistic anthropologists studied seemed really difficult  at best and kind of boring at worst. Terms I had heard thrown around by people  familiar with the topic, terms such as <em>morphology,  syntax, phoneme, copula deletion, </em>and <em>ergative  marker</em> seemed really complicated and impenetrable. I was a cultural  anthropology major &ndash;I wanted to go the field, hang out with some people, and  learn about their culture. Language just seemed to be a means to an end: I had  to learn the language of the people I was going to work with if I was going to  communicate with them. But other than that, I didn&rsquo;t really think there was  much more else to language and its role in culture. </p>
<p>I LOVED my first ling anth class! My professor, Dr. Laura  Ahearn, taught the course in a really accessible way and repeatedly  demonstrated the ways in which language is much more than just a tool for  communication: it does <em>all</em> kinds of  cool things!</p>
<h2 class="bullet">What kind of &ldquo;cool things&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>Think about this example: Two Yucatec Maya speakers,  Mercedes and Efra&iacute;n, are having a conversation. </p>
<dl class="inline normal">
<dt>Mercedes:</dt> <dd>Bix a beel, jEfra&iacute;n?</dd>
  <dt>Efra&iacute;n:</dt> <dd>Jach ma&rsquo;alob, jMech, Toj in wool bejlae.</dd></dl>
  <p>Mercedes just asked Efra&iacute;n how he is doing, and Efra&iacute;n  responded that he is doing very well. However, if we were to translate this  exchange word for word, this is what it would look like:</p>
<dl class="inline normal">  
  <dt>Mercedes:</dt> <dd>How is your road, [male marker] Efra&iacute;n?</dd>
  <dt>Efra&iacute;n:</dt> <dd>Very good, [male marker]Mech, my heart is straight  today.</dd></dl>
<p>What does this exchange tell us about how Maya people think  about the world? The Yucatec Maya language is full of &ldquo;path&rdquo; imagery. When we  part our hair, the white line of scalp that is visible is called a &ldquo;path&rdquo;. In an agricultural society that relies  heavily on a form of agriculture called <em>milpa</em>,  Maya people often have to travel long distances in the forest to get to their  fields. Finding the right path is  crucial to a family&rsquo;s survival. Very often, people talk about life as a journey  down a hopefully straight or <em>&ldquo;toj&rdquo;</em> path. Examining the <em>semantics</em> (meaning) and <em>pragmatics</em> (practice)  of a language can thus really tell us something about the culture and people  that speak it. </p>
<h3>So what are we doing this semester?</h3>
<p>As I said before, my interest in linguistic anthropology  developed because I had a GREAT ling anth instructor. You may or may not have  noticed, but the textbook I use in this class was written by Dr. Laura Ahearn.  I love this book because she does in the book exactly what she did in the  class: she explains complicated concepts in an accessible and engaging way. As  your professor, I hope to do what she did: to show you how interesting and  relevant understanding the connection between language and culture really is. </p>
<p>I hope we have a great semester together. I am excited to be  teaching this class and I hope that I will do it effectively enough to make you  excited about being a student in my class.  I try to be approachable, challenging, and fair in my teaching. Please  feel free to come to me, in person or electronically, at any time. </p>
