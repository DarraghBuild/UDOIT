<h1>Instructor Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome! My name is Beatriz Reyes-Foster and I am a  professor in the Department of Anthropology. I am very excited to be your  professor this semester, I love anthropology and I think that studying Language  and Culture is really, really fascinating. I hope to convey some of my passion  for what I do during this semester and I am always happy to talk to students  about what it&rsquo;s like to be an anthropologist.</p>
<p>My academic background is in sociocultural anthropology,  though I consider my work to fall within the field of medical anthropology.  Right now, I am studying public mental health in Yucat&aacute;n, Mexico. I am  especially interested in how public mental health models that are designed in  the United States are understood by Yucatec Maya people who use these services.  However, in my career I have studied <strong>LOTS</strong> of other fascinating aspects of  culture, all of which inform my thinking: mortuary ritual, religion, history,  and globalization, just to name a few. </p>
<p>I have conducted ethnographic fieldwork in the Lake Atitl&aacute;n  region of Guatemala, in Yucat&aacute;n, Mexico, and in suburban New Jersey.</p>

<p>I LOVE doing  fieldwork and I love that I have a job that lets me pursue research. In class  and online, you will hear me often referring back to my own research  experiences when discussing course material. </p>
<p>I really hope you enjoy this class!!!!!!</p>
<h2 class="bullet">About Me</h2>
<p>I am originally from Yucat&aacute;n, Mexico, but have lived in the  United States since childhood. I did my undergraduate work at Rutgers  University in New Jersey (where I studied under the author of our textbook and  fell in love with anthropology!) and then went on to obtain my Ph.D. from UC  Berkeley, on one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States. </p>

<p>I have a toddler I talk about often precisely because he&rsquo;s  in the middle of acquiring language, and just because he&rsquo;s awesome &#9786;. I also really like <em>The Office</em>, cooking, and traveling.  Oh, and I&rsquo;m an NPR addict so I will often incorporate interesting  stories I hear on it into my courses.</p>
