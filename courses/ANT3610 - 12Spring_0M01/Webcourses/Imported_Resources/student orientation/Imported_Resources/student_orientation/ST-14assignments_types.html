<h1>Assignment Types</h1>
<div class="m3x">
<p>There are two different assignment types in Webcourses@UCF: <strong class="bl">Text with Attachments</strong> and <strong class="bl">Web Site</strong>. Your instructor will provide you with directions for assignments, that may sometimes be included in the learning modules. Be sure to locate the specific instructions for assignments. </p>
</div>
<h2>Text with Attachments</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>For text with attachments assignments, you may either  submit your assignment by  uploading and attaching files that you created outside of Webcourses@UCF or by entering text directly into the text box.  If you use the text box, you may have the option of formatting the text with the HTML Creator. </p>
<p><strong class="bl">Example:</strong> For an English Literature course you might be asked to submit an essay on one of the novels you studied in class. You could either write your essay in Webcourses@UCF using the HTML Creator, or you could use a program such as Microsoft Word and then upload and attach the file.</p>

</div>
<h2>Web Site</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>
For Web site assignments, you are required to create a Web site that contains linked HTML pages. You must specify an entry point or index page for your Web site and use relative links to link all of the pages. As with text with attachments assignments, you can create the HTML files in Webcourses@UCF using the HTML Creator  or you can create the files using a program outside of Webcourses@UCF. If you create them outside, you must  compress them and then  upload and attach them. </p>
<p><strong class="bl">Example:</strong> For a Web Design course, you might be asked to submit an example of a Web site you have created. You could create the HTML files outside of Webcourses@UCF, compress (zip) the files, and upload and attach them. When prompted by Webcourses@UCF, you would select the index.html file to be used as the starting page.</p>
  <p class="c"><strong>Web Site Assignment</strong><br /><img src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/html_creator.jpg" alt="Web site sssignment" width="569" height="253" class="img_border" /></p>
  <p>You may be required to work on an assignment 
    individually or with other students in a group. We'll look briefly at these options next.</p>
