	The assignments 
          you encounter in your online course are much like the assignments you would encounter 
          in a regular classroom. For example, you may be asked to complete questions, 
          exercises, and written work or essays in order to help you gain a better 
          understanding of the course material. To turn in these items, you will use the Assignment tool. This can also be referred to as the Drop Box or In Box in an online course.

<p>There are two types of assignments in Webcourses@UCF: <strong class="bl">Text with Attachments</strong> and <strong class="bl">Web Site</strong>. You may be required to work on your assignments <strong class="bl">individually</strong> or with other students in a <strong class="bl">group</strong>.</p>

<h2>Assignments Features</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>The Assignments tool also includes the following features: </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Each assignment has a due date; you may or may not be able to submit your assignment late.</li>
      <li>Your assignment may be gradable and count towards your final grade for the course.</li>
    <li>You may be able to sign up for the assignment topic or group of your choice.</li>
	<li>You or your instructor may publish your assignment submission to the entire class to allow for peer review.</li>
	<li>You may be able to take back, edit, and resubmit assignment submissions.</li>
  </ul>
<p>If the Assignments tool has been added to your course, it will appear under Course Tools. If you click the <strong>Assignments</strong> icon (paper and ruler), you are taken to the main screen for the Assignments tool. Alternatively, your instructor may add an assignment to a learning module, the Course Content Home, another folder, or the Action Menu of a learning module. If you click the assignment icon, you are taken to a screen that contains that specific assignment.</p>
<p>Let's learn more about the the two assignment types next.</p>
