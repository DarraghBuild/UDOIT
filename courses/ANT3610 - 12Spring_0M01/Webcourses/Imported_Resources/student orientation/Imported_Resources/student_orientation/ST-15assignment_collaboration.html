<h1>Assignment Collaboration Options</h1>
<div class="m3x">
  <p>Assignments can be assigned to individual 
  students or to groups of students. The following describes the 
  differences between the two options:</p>
</div>
<h2>Individual</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>When 
assignments are assigned to individual students, all students in the 
class receive the same assignment. You must work independently on the 
assignment and, if the assignment is gradable, you receive your own 
grade. </p>
<p><strong class="bl">Example:</strong> For an Education course, you might receive a 
&quot;text with attachments&quot; assignment, instructing you to submit a lesson 
plan based on your favorite children's book. You would work 
independently, submit an individual lesson plan, and you would receive 
an individual grade.</p>	
</div>
<h2>Group</h2>
<div class="m3x">
        <p>When assignments are assigned to 
        groups of students, you must work collaboratively or cooperatively with other students, 
        and all students within your group may receive the same grade. Your 
        instructor may assign you to a group or you may have the option of 
        signing-up for the group of your choice.</p>
        <p><strong class="bl">Example:</strong> For an Art History course, you might receive a 
        group assignment to complete a Web site that describes the work of the artists of the 
        Renaissance. Your group would submit a single Web site, and all students 
        within the group may receive the same 
  		grade.</p>

  <p>Now that you understand the types of assignments you might encounter, let's look at navigating the Assignments tool. </p>
