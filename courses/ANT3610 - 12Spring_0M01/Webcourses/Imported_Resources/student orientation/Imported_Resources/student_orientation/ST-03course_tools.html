<h2>Course Tools</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>Any tools that your instructor has added to the course appear under  <strong class="bl">Course Tools</strong> and <strong class="bl">My Tools</strong>. The Course Tools and My Tools menus always appear in the left-hand frame of any page you navigate to in the course.</p>
<p class="c"><strong>Course Tools</strong><br /><img src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/course_tools.jpg" alt="Course Tools" width="581" height="204" class="img_border" /></p>

<p>When you access a tool from Course Tools or My Tools, you are taken to the main screen for that tool. For example, if you access the Discussions tool from Course Tools, you are taken to the main screen for the Discussions, where you can see all of the course discussion topics, including any discussions that have been added to the Course Content Home or other learning modules in the course.</p>

	If new content has been added to a tool, an asterisk appears next to the tool name.  <img src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/asterisk.jpg" alt="New content" width="125" height="21" class="img_border" />

<h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>As you navigate from the Course Content Home to the individual tools and other content that has been added to the course, your progress through each page is tracked through <strong class="bl">Breadcrumbs</strong>. The Breadcrumbs always appear at the top of every page you visit in your course.</p> 
<p class="c"><strong>The Breadcrumbs<br /></strong><img src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/breadcrumbs.jpg" alt="The Breadcrumbs" width="504" height="143" class="img_border" /></p>
<p>The Breadcrumbs allow you to retrace your steps through the course by providing a link to previously visited pages; clicking the link returns you to that page.</p>

	
<p>Now that you're ready to navigate through the course content and tools, let's take a look at some of the common online tools.</p>
