<h1>Navigating  Assignments</h1>
<div class="m3x">
<p>When you access the Assignments tool from  Course Tools, you are taken to the main screen for the Assignments tool, which lists all of the assignments your instructor has made available to you.</p>
<p class="c"><strong class="bl">The Assignments Screen</strong> <br /><img

<p>The Assignments tool organizes all of your assignments and submissions into the following four  tabs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inbox</strong>: Contains all the assignments that are currently available to you, including assignments you have not yet started to work on, assignments you have started to work on and have saved as a draft, and assignments you submitted but that your instructor has returned to you for revision.</li> 
  <li><strong>Submitted</strong>: Contains all of the assignments that you have submitted  that have not yet been graded. </li>
  <li><strong>Graded</strong>: Contains all of your submissions that have been graded. </li>
  <li><strong>Published</strong>: Contains all assignments that have been published for the class to view. </li>
</ul>

<p> Each tab provides information regarding the assignments, including  whether you're to work individually or in a group, the due date, whether you've begun working on the assignment, and, if applicable, your grade.</p>

<p>To open an assignment or submission, click its title.</p>
<p>Now that you have an idea of how assignments are organized in the Assignments tool, let's take a look at how to complete and submit assignments.</p>
