<h1>Discussion Topics and Threads</h1>
<h2>Discussion Topics</h2>
<div class="m3x">
  <p>Discussion topics are listed on the main screen for the Discussions tool. Your instructor may provide a brief description of the topic, elaborating on the subject or providing instructions or suggestions. You and your classmates can post messages in response to the topic as well as respond to one another's posted messages.</p>

<h2>Discussion Threads</h2>
<div class="m3x">
 <p>A series of replies to the same message is called a <strong class="bl">thread</strong>. You are probably already familiar with threads, as threads in the Discussions tool are just like the threads that are created in a typical e-mail. For example, when someone sends you an e-mail and you reply to it, the subject heading does not change and the sender's message appears below yours; this is a thread. Alternatively, if you were to compose a <i>new message</i> rather than <i>reply to</i> the original message, the messages are not threaded.</p>

 <p>There can be multiple threads within a topic.</p>
 <p>Now that you're familiar with topics and threads, let's look at navigating the Discussions tool.</p>
