				As its name implies, the Discussions tool is used to facilitate class discussions. Your instructor will typically post a discussion topic related to the course material and you and your classmates respond by posting messages. The Discussions tool is much like a message board in an online community, as communication does not take place in real time and messages are organized into threads.

        <h2>Discussions Features</h2>
        <div class="m3x">
            <p>The Discussions tool has the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can attach files to messages. For example, you might want to attach a document to allow your peers to review it and provide comments.</li>
                <li>Your instructor may create a topic that is assigned specifically to a group of which you are a member.</li>
                <li>Your instructor may lock a topic, so that the messages are read-only and you cannot post any new messages.</li>
                <li>Discussion topics may be gradable, meaning that your participation in the discussion will be counted towards your final grade for the course.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the Discussions tool has been added to your course, it will appear under Course Tools. If you click the <strong>Discussions</strong> icon, you are taken to the main screen for the Discussions tool. Other alternative locations where you will find the link to discussion topics are within a learning module; on the Course Content Home; in another folder; or in the Action Menu of a learning module. If you click the discussion topic icon, you are taken to a screen that contains that specific discussion topic.</p>
            <p>Let's look at discussion topics and threads next.</p>
