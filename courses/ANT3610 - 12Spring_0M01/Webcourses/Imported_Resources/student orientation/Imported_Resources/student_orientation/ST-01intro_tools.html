	<h1>Getting Started with Your Online Course</h1>

	<h2>Welcome to Online Courses</h2>

	<p>Every online course is unique. For example, your instructor may be using Webcourses@UCF to supplement a course taught in a regular classroom environment and may only add a couple of key tools to the course. Alternatively, your course may be taught entirely online and a variety of tools and content may be added to your online course.</p>
	<p>UCF provides the <a href="http://learn.ucf.edu">Learning Online Web site</a> to help you in your online experiences. There are many resources and helpful hints and tips available at this Web site. If you have questions about online learning, check there first. The address is <a href="http://learn.ucf.edu">http://learn.ucf.edu</a>.</p>
	<p>The following module will assist you in learning about the latest upgrade of UCF's course management system.</p>
	<h2>The Webcourses@UCF Tool Set</h2>

	<div class="m3x">

		<p>Online courses have a variety of tools that are used to create a learning environment that closely mirrors a regular classroom environment. Essentially, there are three types of Webcourses@UCF tools: <strong class="bl">Course Content Tools</strong>, <strong class="bl">Communication Tools</strong>, and <strong class="bl">Evaluation Tools</strong>.</p>

	</div>

	<h3>Course Content Tools</h3>

	<div class="m3x">

		<p>Course Content tools are used to deliver course material, such as the course syllabus, online lectures, and relevant web links, to you. Some of the Course Content tools include:</p>

		</ul>

	</div>

	<h3>Communication Tools</h3>

		If you encounter questions while using Webcourses@UCF, you can access the online help by clicking the <strong>Help</strong> link. The link appears in the top right-hand frame of every page. <img class="img_border" alt="Help link" src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/help.gif" /> Just in time help is provided for the component you are currently viewing.

		</p>

		<p>Because each course is unique, the tools you use and how you navigate your online course will depend on how it's been set up. However, there are some features that are commonly used to organize course content and to allow you to access tools. Let's get started by taking a look at these common features.</p>
