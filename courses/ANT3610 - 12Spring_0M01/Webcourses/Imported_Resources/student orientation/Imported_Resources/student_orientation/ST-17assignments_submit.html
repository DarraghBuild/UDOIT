<h1>Completing and Submitting Assignments</h1>

<h2>Opening Assignments from the Inbox</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>When you access an assignment from the Inbox, it opens in a screen that provides you with the assignment instructions, due date, and type. Your instructor might also attach a file with additional information regarding the assignment.</p>
<p class="c"><strong>The Edit Submission Screen<br /></strong><img src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/Edit_Submissions.jpg" alt="The Edit Submission screen" width="606" height="390" class="img_border" /></p>
<p>From this screen, you can enter your assignment submission in the text box provided and/or attach a file that contains your submission. Remember to follow the instructor's instructions. If you're not ready to submit your work, you can <strong>Save as Draft</strong> and return to your submission later; once you've finished working, you can <strong>Submit</strong> it. </p>
<p>

    If you choose to create your work within the Assignment tool (HTML Creator), it is advisable to Save as Draft often.

<h2>Viewing Your Submissions</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>Once you submit your assignment, it appears under the <strong class="bl">Submitted</strong> tab. Alternatively, if you miss submitting by the cutoff date for an assignment, the assignment link is automatically moved to the <strong class="bl">Submissions</strong> tab. From this tab, you can review your submission, but you can't make any changes to your work.</p>

<p>Once your instructor grades your submission, it appears in the <strong class="bl">Graded</strong> tab, although your instructor may not release your grade immediately. If you want to view any comments and feedback that your instructor has provided, open your submission.</p>

<p>You or your instructor may publish your submission, allowing everyone in the class to view your work and provide you with feedback. Published submissions are moved to the <strong class="bl">Published</strong> tab.</p>
<p><strong class="bl">Note:</strong> Instructor settings determine whether you can publish your own submission. <br />
</p>
</div>
<h2>Resubmitting Assignments That Have Been Returned to You</h2>
<div class="m3x">
<p>Sometimes your instructor will return your submission to you so that you can work on it further. When this happens, the assignment appears in the <strong class="bl">Inbox</strong> again. When you open the assignment, you can re-read the instructions, read the instructor's comments, view your old submission, and enter and/or attach a new submission. </p>
<p class="c"><img src="http://trident.cdws.ucf.edu/webcourses/student_orientation/images/review.jpg" alt="Returned assignment" width="784" height="440" class="img_border" /></p>
<p>You can save your second attempt as a draft or submit it just as you would any assignment.</p>
<p>You're ready to complete and submit assignments! Let's take a look at taking and submitting assessments next.</p>
