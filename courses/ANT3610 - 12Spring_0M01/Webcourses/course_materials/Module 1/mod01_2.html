<h1>Module 1 &ndash; Language is Socially  Charged</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Before you Read </h2>
<p>Welcome to the most important module of the semester! I say  this not because the material covered in our other modules <em>isn&rsquo;t </em>important, but because you need to understand the concepts  explained in this module in order to understand any of the information covered  in our other modules. This is particularly important if you do not have a  background in linguistics.</p>
<p>This module is meant to guide your reading &ndash;you should read  this and the Focus Points section of the module before you begin reading. This  module focuses on the most important aspects of the material covered in this  week&rsquo;s class. It does not replicate the information in your textbook; rather,  it highlights and enhances important information and provides supplementary  materials to further your understanding of the subject matter. </p>
<p>This week we will not be meeting f2f (face to face).  Carefully review this module, complete the graded discussion assignment, and  post any questions you might have to the &ldquo;Ask Dr. Reyes-Foster&rdquo; discussion  board. Chances are if you have a question about the course, others do too!! </p>
<p>Words that have been <strong>emphasized </strong>require special attention and should appear in assessments such as our  graded group discussions, or in tests or quizzes. The supplementary materials  in this module are meant to better illustrate the concepts and ideas discussed  in the reading. </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Focus Points</h2>
<p>As you read, you pay special attention to the following  themes, concepts, and issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The primary difference between linguistics and       linguistic anthropology.</li>
  <li>Pay special attention to how <strong>Chomsky&rsquo;s</strong> approach       to language and how it contrasts to that of linguistic anthropologists. <strong> </strong></li>
  <li>The five basic components of a language that can be       studied.</li>
  <li>The four key terms in linguistic anthropology</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bullet">Chomsky and Knitting</h2>
<p>What does it mean to &ldquo;know&rdquo; a language? <strong>Chomsky</strong> draws a distinction between <strong>competence</strong>, the abstract and usually unconscious knowledge of a  language, and <strong>performance</strong>, the  putting into practice of the language. De Saussure makes a nearly identical  distinction between <strong>langue</strong>, the  language system in the abstract, and <strong>parole</strong>,  everyday speech.  Ahearn uses a knitting  metaphor to explain this: a person might have an abstract knowledge of how to  knit a sweater (<strong>competence</strong>) but in  actually knitting the sweater he or she may drop a stich or make the arms a bit  too long or short. To both Chomsky and De Saussure, the abstract knowledge of  the system is what&rsquo;s important. Neither is very interested in the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of the  system.</p>
<p>To continue with the knitting metaphor, Chomsky and his  students are primarily interested in the abstract rules of Knitting. He would  be uninterested in</p>
<ul>
  <li>How or why people knit in various cultures</li>
  <li>How knitting practices have changed over time</li>
  <li>The gendered nature of knitting in specific societies</li>
  <li>The different meanings attached to knitting in each of  the following images: </li>
</ul>
<p>Image Below: Cover from a knitting book titled &ldquo;<cite class="normal">naughty  needles</cite>&rdquo; showing a woman dressed in a knit two-piece bathing suit posed  suggestively. &copy; Robyn Edem  Source: <cite>Naughty Needles</cite> by Nikol  Lohr.</p>
<p><img src="naughty_needles.jpg" alt=""Naughty Needles" book cover, showing a woman dressed in knit two-piece bathing suit posed suggestively" /><img src="knitting.jpg" alt="A drawing of a group of women sitting in a knitting circle" /></p>
<p>What do the images above convey? What sorts of cultural icons come to  mind as you look at them? The images above are an example of the kind of  information Chomsky might miss if his focus in only on the rules of knitting.  Similarly, linguistic anthropologists are interested in the ways in which  language is an intrinsic part of social life. </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Five Components of Language</h2>
<p>In the  textbook (page 11), Ahearn outlines five basic areas of language that can be  studied:</p> 
<dl class="inline normal">
	<dt><strong>phonology</strong></dt> <dd>(the study of  sound in language),</dd> <dt><strong>morphology</strong></dt> <dd>(the  study of the internal structures of words),</dd> <dt><strong>syntax</strong></dt> <dd>(the study of the structure of sentences),</dd> <dt><strong>semantics</strong></dt> <dd>(the study of meaning in  language), and</dd> <dt><strong>pragmatics</strong></dt> <dd>(the study  of language use).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Linguists  tend to study the first three (<strong>phonology</strong>,<strong> morphology</strong>, and <strong>syntax</strong>); <strong>Linguistic</strong> Anthropologists tend to study the last two (<strong>semantics </strong>and<strong> pragmatics</strong>).</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Examples of Linguistic Anthropology</h2>
<p>Take a  minute to review the ethnographies of language described in pages 12-17. How do  you think that <strong>semantics</strong> and <strong>pragmatics</strong> come into play in these  studies? How are these studies different from and similar to each other? All of  these studies share two basic tenets: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Language  must not be studied in isolation from social practices.</li>
  <li>Questions  about social practices and meanings can be answered by paying close attention  to language.</li>
</ul>
