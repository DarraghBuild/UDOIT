		<h1>Module 1: Language is Socially Charged</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			This week, we will begin by considering what characteristics of langua
			ge make it interesting to study from an anthropological perspective.  We will also learn a little bit about linguistics and the way in which they empirically study languages. Finally, we will discuss the primary differences between linguistics and linguistic anthropology. This week we will not be meeting f2f; therefore, you will find the material in this module is more extensive than that of modules that include a f2f component. Be sure to read the content in this module carefully and simultaneously with your text and to meet required deadlines for our first graded discussion of the semester. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Module Objectives</h2>
		<p>By the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Describe linguistic anthropology and its object of study.</li>
			<li>List all 5 basic components of language and explain which components have traditionally been of interest to linguists and which have been of interest to linguistic anthropologists.</li>
			<li>Explain the four key terms guiding this course: <em>multifunctionality, language ideologies, practice,</em> and <em>Indexicality.</em></li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="bullet">Time Management</h2>
		<p>This course is designed to maximize benefits gained from our weekly f2f meeting. In order for our class meeting to enhance and further deepen your understanding of course materials and help you achieve our module objectives, I suggest you manage your time wisely.
