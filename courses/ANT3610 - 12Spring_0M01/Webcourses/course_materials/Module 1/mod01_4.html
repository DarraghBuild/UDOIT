		<h1>Module 1: Assignment</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Assignment Overview</h2>
		<p>This week&#8217;s assignment is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Complete the graded group discussion.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="bullet">Instructions</h2>
		<p>Complete the assigned reading for this week.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ahearn, Laura. 2012. Ch. 1: Language is Socially Charged.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In your small group discussion, write a reaction to this week&#8217;s materials. Did this week&#8217;s reading make you think differently about language? Draw parallels to your own everyday life and experience. Were any of the concepts challenging, is there anything unclear in the material that you would like to discuss? <em>Your original post must be online by<strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Wednesday</strong>.</em> After you post your initial reaction to this week&#8217;s materials, you must also respond to someone else&#8217;s post in a thoughtful, provocative manner. <em>Your response must be posted by <strong>midnight</strong> on <strong>Friday</strong>.</em> Please be sure to respect our netiquette and write clearly, concisely, and correctly. You will find an example of a thoughtful, original post and reply (on a different topic) in the discussion board.</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Looking forward&#8230;</h2>
		<p>Next week, we will be discussing research methods in Linguistic anthropology. In our first f2f class, we will also be watching a film on nonverbal communication, &#8220;<cite class="normal">A World of Gestures: Culture &amp; Nonverbal Communication.</cite>&#8221;</p>
		<p>I hope you found this module interesting. I look forward to meeting all of you in our first f2f class!!!</p>
