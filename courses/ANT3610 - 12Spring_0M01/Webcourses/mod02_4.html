		<h1>Module 2: Research Question Exercise</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Sample Research Questions</h2>
		<p>Last semester, student were asked to formulate research questions based on a cursory reading of Ahearn&#8217;s Chapter 2. Some of them are pasted below:</p>
		<p>
			Question #1
			<br/>
			
			<br/>
			In what ways has texting and online chatting affected daily face to face language practices?
			<br/>
			
			<br/>
			Question #2
			<br/>
			
			<br/>
			Why do people who attend concerts feel the urge to scream nonstop while the performer is up on stage?
			<br/>
			
			<br/>
			Question #3
			<br/>
			
			<br/>
			What is the root of the Southern accent used in the Southern United States and what sets it apart from the root of the accents used in the New England states?
			<br/>
			
			<br/>
			Question #4
			<br/>
			
			<br/>
			How does the speaking of a disappearing indigenous language affect a speaker&#8217;s social status in the native culture?
			<br/>
			
			<br/>
			Question #5
			<br/>
			
			<br/>
			How are alternative forms of speech used in theatrical performances?
			<br/>
			(for instance, Old English at a renaissance fair, using musical instruments in lieu of language, or using fictitious languages such as Elvish or Klingon)
		</p>
		<p>Note, however, that these questions have not been justified &#8211;besides formulating a research question, you still need to take a few moments to explain to me and to your group why you chose this particular question, what your reasoning is, and, if relevant, what part of your reading inspired you to write your particular question.</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Sample Appropriate Methodology</h2>
		<p>At random, I chose a research question and wrote down one possible way of answering it:</p>
		<p>Question #3 can be answered by doing historical research of written texts alongside voice recordings of specific utterances spoken by native speakers of Southern American English and other kinds of American English. Transcription and subsequent phonological analysis would aid in establishing how the different forms of American English differ from one another. This question can be further expanded to include language ideologies about these different forms of English, which can be explored through open-ended interviews and matched guise tests.</p>
		<p>Again, you don&#8217;t have to do exactly what I&#8217;ve done, but note, for instance, that I mention the possibility of doing historical research alongside linguistic data gathering, even if the textbook doesn&#8217;t explicitly mention historical research as a methodology. You won&#8217;t lose points for being creative, but I do want you to justify (explain) <em>why</em> you think a particular methodology is relevant.</p>
