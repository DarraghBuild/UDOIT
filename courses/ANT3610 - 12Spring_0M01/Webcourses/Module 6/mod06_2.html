<h1>Module 6: Multilingualism and  Globalization</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Before you Read</h2>
<p>At some point,  you may have heard someone say, &ldquo;This is America. Speak English!&rdquo; For more than  a decade, groups in the United States have come coalesced around the idea that  &ldquo;one country equals one language&rdquo; and have lobbied for the passing of  &ldquo;English-only&rdquo; legislation. However, how common is it for societies to be  bi-lingual or multi-lingual? Is the speaking of one &ldquo;official&rdquo; language  important for maintaining group cohesiveness? What is the relationship between  power and language? Why is &ldquo;protecting the English language&rdquo; so important to  many Americans?</p>
<p>In this  module, we must set personal politics aside and consider these questions from  an anthropological perspective. While multilingualism is prevalent around the  world, understanding the relationship between language ideologies and the  speakers of various languages &ndash;and recognizing that in many multilingual  societies not all languages are considered equal&mdash;is key to understanding the  multiple meanings of language in societies. </p>
<p>The online  component of this week&rsquo;s module will focus on supplementing materials related  to globalization, specifically <strong>heteroglossia </strong>and <strong>transidiomatic practices, </strong>concepts  associated with globalization, and the ethnographic case of the English-only  movement in the United States. Please note that we will be discussing ALL the  material in our f2f class. This online module is simply meant to <em>supplement</em> your reading. </p>
<p>Remember,  items that have been <strong>bolded </strong>are  especially important and are likely to appear in tests or quizzes, and should  be mentioned in discussion posts. Also, this module is meant to be read <em>alongside</em> your assigned reading in order  to guide and supplement the book, but is not meant to <em>substitute </em>your reading the book. </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Focus Points</h2>
<p>As you read your book and this module, pay special attention  to the following concept. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Code-switching,       code-mixing, </strong>and <strong>diglossia.</strong></li>
  <li>Linguistic <strong>registers </strong>and the linguistic anthropological position on <strong>languages </strong>and <strong>dialects.</strong></li>
  <li>The <strong>English-only       movement, language ideologies</strong> and common misconceptions about language       acquisition and immigration in the United States. </li>
  <li><strong>heteroglossia </strong>and <strong>transidiomatic practices</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bullet">Globalization</h2>
<h3>The English-Only Movement in the United States </h3>
<p>The English-only movement in the United States gained a  reputation for prejudice, intolerance, and racism in the first decade of the 21st  century. Today, people who believe that one nation equals have formed  non-profit organizations such as <a href="http://www.us-english.org/">Official  English</a>, <a href="http://www.proenglish.org/">Proenglish</a>, and <a href="http://englishfirst.org/">English First</a>. These organizations advocate  for the official recognition of English in federal and state law. Many of these  websites claim to be the &ldquo;leading defenders of English&rdquo; and present highly  critical views of multilingualism in the United States. </p>
<p>The English-only movement is a highly emotional topic for  many people because it closely linked to the hotly contested immigration  debate. Our aim in this module is not to debate immigration policy or to  criticize the opinion that immigrants should learn English. Rather, our aim is  to look at this movement and the debates linked to it as anthropologists and  ask not whether one side is &ldquo;right&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;why is  this such an emotionally charged and important issue for so many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The anxiety felt by many supporters of the English-only  movement can be related to any one of the following reasons (this list is not  exhaustive). </p>
<ul>
  <li>A cultural preference for homogeneity.</li>
  <li>Xenophobia </li>
  <li>A fear of societal change.</li>
  <li>Ignorance of: 
  <ol>
  	<li>languages other than English,</li>
  	<li>the long-term patterns of language acquisition in the United States,</li>
  	<li>the highly beneficial nature of multilingualism.</li>
  	<li> the prevalence of multilingualism in other societies </li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  While the some of these motivations may be legitimately  grounded in personal opinion and experience, there are also many misconceptions  about English and the need to maintain one language in order to promote  national unity. These are some common misconceptions about shifting  demographics, language acquisition, and the need to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; English: </p>
  <dl class="inline">
  <dt class="normal"><strong>misconception: </strong></dt><dd>other  immigrant groups were more eager to assimilate in the past. New immigrants are  not willing to learn English and their children aren&rsquo;t learning English either.</dd>
  <dt class="normal"><strong>Reality: </strong></dt><dd>With some  limited regional exceptions (e.g. the Pennsylvania Dutch in Lancaster county,  Pennsylvania, other Amish and Mennonite communities in the United States, and the  Hasidic Jewish community in New York City), by the third generation descendants  of immigrants will be predominantly monolingual English speakers. This remains  as true of immigrant communities today as it was in the past. Overwhelmingly, the  vast majority of people who immigrate to the United States and their children<strong> will </strong>learn English<strong> </strong>because it indispensible to financial and social success. What is  more, the children and grandchildren of immigrants are very likely to <strong>not </strong>know any other languages except  English. </dd>
  <dt class="normal"><strong>Misconception: </strong></dt><dd>English  is in danger of being overtaken by other languages if it is not protected by  law.</dd>
 <dt class="normal"> <strong>Reality: (</strong>Monolingual)</dt><dd>  English remains the <em>lingua franca</em> of  the United States. Not only are most Americans born in the US English speakers,  they are also <strong>monolingual</strong>: that is,  regardless of their cultural or ethnic backgrounds, the vast majority of  American children speak <em>only</em> English.  Despite large numbers of immigrants to the United States, there is no evidence  that the English language is at all &ldquo;endangered.&rdquo;</dd>
  <dt class="normal"><strong>Misconception: </strong></dt><dd>A  nation needs one language to hold its people together. Without an officially  recognized language, American society could descend into chaos, anarchy, and a  loss of all that we hold dear.</dd>
  <dt class="normal"><strong>Reality: </strong></dt><dd>Monolingual  preference of one language as a national lingua franca is not a cultural universal.  Many nations do not recognize an official language, or recognize several  official languages. Recognition of an official language does not inherently  promote national unity. Many nations that have recognized an official language  remain highly divided. </dd>
  </dl>
<h3>Heteroglossia</h3>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve read in your text, <strong>diglossia</strong> refers to the compartmentalized use of two different <strong>codes </strong>(languages) that are <strong>hierarchically related </strong>to one another. Russian  literary critic <strong>Mikhail Bakhtin</strong> proposed that language use in everyday life is <em>always</em> stratified in multiple ways. The idea behind <strong>heteroglossia</strong> is that there are two  opposing forces in language: a <strong>centralizing/centripetal </strong>force used by authoritative entities such as governments that want to make  a unitary, standard way of speaking; and a <strong>decentralizing/centrifugal </strong>force that leads to greater stratification and more variation. While these  concepts are useful in any society, Globalization has brought these forces into  sharp relief: as we have become more and more interconnected English has  assumed an important role as an international <em>lingua franca</em> and is spoken by an increasing number of people  around the world. By the same token, another characteristic of globalization,  migration, has resulted in greater decentralization and linguistic diversity in  more communities than ever before. </p>
<h3>Transidiomatic  Practices</h3>
<p>According to globalization theorist Marco Jacquemet, <strong>transidiomatic practices</strong> are the kinds  of communications that exist only because of the phenomenon of globalization:  the interactions of transnational groups using languages and codes that are  present in a range of &ldquo;communicative channels&rdquo; both local and distant. </p>
<p>I have found that students often find this term quite  confusing. This short <a href="http://youtu.be/2g0XMx1sFEA">film</a> will  hopefully give you a concrete (and very funny!) example. </p>
 <p> How is <cite>Call Center</cite> an example of transidiomatic practices? The main characters in the film are  communicating across vast physical and cultural distances with one another, but  at the same time are joined in a single globalized system of <strong>economies</strong> and <strong>technology</strong> that makes this communication possible. Not only are  their multiple languages present in their interactions (American English,  Indian English, and Hindi all make an appearance), but the cultural subtexts  brought to the table by each character (the call-center operator, the  supervisor, the angry college student, the suburban housewife, the depressed  teenage girl&hellip;) are all vastly different from one another and simultaneously  unified in the form of phones in an operator&rsquo;s cubicle. What&rsquo;s more, these  communicative practices, a hallmark of the increased movement of technology,  money, and culture characteristic of globalization, all take place without a  single one of the characters moving anywhere. </p>
