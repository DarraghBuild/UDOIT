		<h1>Module 6: Multilingualism and Globalization</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
		<p>This week, we will study <strong>multilingualism</strong>, or the ability to speak several languages. We will consider the ways in which people who speak more than one language <strong>switch</strong>, <strong>mix</strong>, and <strong>separate</strong> languages according to different social settings, values, and norms. We will also consider the differences between <strong>languages</strong> and <strong>dialects</strong>, and the role <strong>language ideologies</strong> in creating structures of power that are linked to and mediated by language. Finally, we will consider the ways in which globalization has created a whole new set of linguistic practices that are heavily laden with cultural meaning that extends over vast distances. In this module, we will also be talking about why multilingualism in certain settings (particularly the United States) can be <strong>controversial</strong>. Finally, in our f2f meeting we will be watching the pbs documentary <em>Speaking in Tongues</em> about alternative language immersion programs in the United States.</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
		<p>After completing this module, you should be able to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Explain the benefits of multilingualism studied by Claudia Dreyfus (see reading below).</li>
			<li>Define and explain the differences between <strong>code-switching</strong>, <strong>code-mixing</strong>, and <strong>diglossia</strong>.</li>
			<li>Present specific examples of multilingualism and how they have been analyzed ethnographically.</li>
			<li>Analyze the role of <strong>language ideologies</strong> in forming national opinions about multilingualism.</li>
		</ul>
