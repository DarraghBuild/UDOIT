<h1>Module 6: Assignment</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>This week&rsquo;s assignment is:</p>
<p>Complete the graded group discussion</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Instructions</h2>
<p>Complete the assigned readings for this week. </p>
<p>Again, this week&rsquo;s assigned readings are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ahearn, Laura. 2012. <cite class="normal"><strong>Living  Language</strong></cite>. Chapter 6</li>
  <li>Dreifus, Claudia. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/science/31conversation.html"><cite class="normal">"The  Bilingual Advantage"</cite></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In your small group discussion board, post an original,  thoughtful reflection on this week&rsquo;s topic. While I realize that the topic of  the English-only movement may be controversial, I ask that all of you post your  opinions in a respectful manner and, above all, that <strong>make clear connections between the concepts learned </strong>and the topic  itself. In other words, I don&rsquo;t want to know if you support or oppose  English-only. I want to see you apply concepts such as <strong>language ideology</strong>, <strong>heteroglossia, </strong>and <strong>globalization</strong> to the  ethnographic case presented (or to some other ethnographic example that you feel is  relevant). In your post and response, draw parallels or describe contrast  between our f2f class, the book chapter, material showcased in this module, and  the articles assigned for this week. Think about our <strong>module objectives </strong>as you compose your post. <em>Your original post must be in the discussion  board by </em><strong>midnight </strong><em>on </em><strong>Wednesday</strong>. Subsequently, you must also respond to someone else&rsquo;s  post in a thoughtful, provocative manner. <em>Your response must be posted  by </em><strong>midnight </strong><em>on </em><strong>Friday</strong>.  Please be sure to respect our netiquette and write clearly, concisely,  and correctly. </p>
