<h1>Module 5: Communities</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Introduction </h2>
<p>What exactly  is a &ldquo;community&rdquo; and why is this term important to linguistic anthropologists?  This module deals explicitly with the ways in which linguistic anthropologists  frame and conceptualize groups of people who use language. It uncovers some of  the assumptions and unstated social theories that underpin commonly used  concepts such as <strong>speech community</strong> or <strong>community of practice</strong>, and will  introduce you to some of the most interesting research that furthers our  understanding of the relationship between linguistic practices and social  groups.  </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
<p>After completing this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define <strong>speech       community</strong> and <strong>community of       practice. </strong>Explain how these concepts differ from one another.</li>
  <li>List <strong>Gumperz&rsquo;       criteria</strong> for identifying a speech community. </li>
  <li>Describe some of the <strong>criticisms</strong> made of the speech community model.</li>
  <li>Name <strong>alternatives</strong> proposed to the concept of speech community.  </li>
  <li>Explain the <strong>criteria       for defining a community of practice</strong>.</li>
  <li>Understand an example of close conversation analysis. </li>
  <li>Analyze the merits both the speech community and communities       of practice models.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the appropriateness of each concept for       pursuing specific kinds of research questions</li>
</ul>
