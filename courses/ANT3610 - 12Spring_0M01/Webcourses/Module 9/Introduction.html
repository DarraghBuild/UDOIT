<h1>Module 9: The Racial Dimensions of  Language</h1>

<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the United  States, race is a sometime contentious and difficult topic. However, it is  impossible to deny that there is a profound connection between language, race,  and ethnicity. This connection has been explored by linguistic anthropologists  from a variety of perspectives. American Anthropology was founded in large part  as a scientific enterprise to debunk the idea that race is biological. In this  module, I will introduce the topic of race, giving a brief historical  background on how race has been conceptualized anthropologically before  discussing the relationship between racial and ethnic identity, language  ideologies, and linguistic practices. </p>
<p>This week will  be challenging in terms of the amount of reading expected of you. Not only are  you expected to complete chapter 10 and Urcioli's article on the use of Spanish  and English in a New York Puerto Rican neighborhood, but you are also expected  to have finished reading Keith Basso's book <cite>Portraits  of 'the Whiteman.'</cite> Each of these readings: the book, which focuses closely  on African American English and the Ebonics controversy; the article, which  focuses on the choice to speak Spanish or English in New York city; and Basso's  book, which brings in the question of social relations through the construct of  &quot;the Whiteman&quot; each presents an example of the relevance of race and ethnicity  within many linguistic anthropological analyses, particularly research carried  out in the United States.</p>

<h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity.&quot;</li>
  <li>Explain what is meant by the statement &quot;race is not       biological.&quot;</li>
  <li>List and explain the rules governing African American       English (AAE).</li>
  <li>Analyze connection between identity, race, language       ideologies, and language use.</li>
</ul>
