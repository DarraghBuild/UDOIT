		<h1>Midterm Study Guide</h1>
		<h2 class="bullet">Protocols</h2>
		<p>The midterm exam is worth 150 points of your final grade. It will be available for 24 hours beginning Friday, February 24 at 9:00 am. If you have some serious scheduling conflict that will keep you from taking the final exam on this date. You must get in touch with me IMMEDIATELY.</p>
		<p>The exam will be open-note, open-book. I suggest you print out copies of our learning modules as you may have a hard time accessing them online while you are taking the exam. You will be able to return to questions, but keep in mind you only have 1 hr and 15 minutes to complete the assessment (the length of a class period).</p>
		<p>If you run into technical difficulties during the exam, it is your responsibility to resolve them. This means that you need to keep the help desk&#8217;s number handy [INSERT NUMBER HERE]. Remember, DOCUMENT, DOCUMENT, DOCUMENT!!!! When you call the help desk with a problem they will generate a ticket number for you. This will be your proof that a technical problem really did prevent you from taking the exam.  If your emergency happens after the help desk closes, you must do everything you can to document whatever happened: email me immediately and if possible take screen shots showing what went wrong.</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">How to Study</h2>
		<p>The best way to study is to make outlines for each of these themes. Think about the terms that are <strong>bolded</strong> in our learning modules. Then, think about any terms that seem to recur in both your textbook reading and the supplemental articles. Write definitions for these terms and make sure you can identify their significance. Then, try to summarize each assigned reading in your own words. Again, get together with your class mates and work through these concepts together. Make sure you understand how subtle terms may differ form one another. Come to the review session with questions that aren&#8217;t clear and bring them up in class.</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">The exam</h2>
		<p>150 points divided into 3 sections:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>25 multiple choice questions (2 points each)</li>
			<li>10 short-answer questions (5 points each)</li>
			<li>2  paragraph &#8220;essay&#8221; questions (25 points each)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 class="bullet">Sample Exam Questions</h2>
		<p>These questions are simply meant to give you a sense of what to expect in the exam. They are by no means exhaustive. I strongly recommend you work on them in study groups. When it comes to the paragraph questions, use peer analysis to critique each other&#8217;s work and find places for improvement.</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Tips for the Multiple Choice Questions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Take the practice self-test a few times. These questions are not exhaustive but will help you identify areas you need to strengthen.</li>
			<li>Read carefully. Many of you missed, for instance, that Whorf studied Hopi and SAE languages, or that speech networks &#8211;not communities of practice&#8212;are characterized by the relationships between members. Make sure you re-read the assigned readings and take careful notes.  For your benefit, I am also including some additional sample questions.</li>
			<li>Study in groups!!! Students that study in groups tend to do better than students who study on their own because oftentimes what is missed by one person is noticed by another.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Sample questions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>The study of the internal structure of words is:</li>
			<li>phonology</li>
			<li>morphology</li>
			<li>syntax</li>
			<li>Practice</li>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<li>Goffman&#8217;s participation framework for conversation analysis separates interactions into three different roles:</li>
			<li>Animator, author, principal.</li>
			<li>Voice box, creator, message.</li>
			<li>Signifier, signified, interpretant.</li>
			<li>Thesis, anti-thesis, synthesis.</li>
			<li>Utterance, footing, performer.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>3. A culturally-specific form of language socialization in the United States is which of the following [there may be more than one correct answer]:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>self-lowering</li>
			<li>child-raising</li>
			<li>code-switching</li>
			<li>one-on-one conversations</li>
		</ol>
		<p>4. The following refers to a speech community that is unaware of existence of different, &#8220;standard&#8221; forms of speech.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Speech community</li>
			<li>Nested speech-community</li>
			<li>Speech network</li>
			<li>Community of practice</li>
			<li>Speech area</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 class="bullet">Tips for Short Answer Questions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>These questions will usually require answers that are one word to one (very) short sentence long. If you find that you are trying to explain something and it&#8217;s taking you longer than that, you are probably on the wrong track.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Sample questions</h3>
		<p>1. Gumperz&#8217; criteria for defining a speech community are:</p>
		<p>2. Where did Santa Ana and Parod&#237; study nested speech communities?</p>
		<p>3. The axiomatic view of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis posits that which three things all influence one another?</p>
		<h2 class="bullet">Tips for Essay/Paragraph Questions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Exercise your writing skills. I am including a few essay questions in this study guide. Try to answer them. Keep the following structure in mind:</li>
		</ul>
		<p>[THESIS STATEMENT].[SUPPORTING CLAUSE 1]. [SUPPORTING CLAUSE 2]. [SUPPORTING CLAUSE 3]. [REITERATE THESIS STATEMENT].</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All good writing is organized and to the point. Remember, less is more. I need to see that 1) you understand the material and 2) you can reflect critically on it.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Sample questions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Name and briefly describe two research methods used by linguistic anthropologists.</li>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<2i>Briefly describe indexicality, outline the three types of signs, and present one example for each.</li>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<3i>What are transidiomatic practices? Can you think of any examples of transidiomatic practices you have encountered in your personal life?</li>
		</ol>
