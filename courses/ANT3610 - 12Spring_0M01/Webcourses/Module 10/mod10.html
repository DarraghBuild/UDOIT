<h1>Module 10: Language and Gender</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Before you read</h2>
<p>Take a few minutes to read the two conversations that appear  in pages 187-188 of Ahearn&rsquo;s textbook. Can you identify the gender of the  speakers in each conversation? Why or why not? Gender is an extremely important  part of human identity. Maybe you&rsquo;ve heard people say that women are more  talkative than men, or that men are more competitive in their speech than  women. In this module, we&rsquo;ll learn about some myths and realities of male and  female speech. First, on the online component of our course, we&rsquo;ll discuss the <strong>socially constructed nature of gender</strong>,  and how this construction translates into real and perceived differences in  male and female speech. In the f2f component of our class, we will build on  this knowledge to discuss the supplemental readings and to consider the ways in  which other concepts we have learned so far such as <strong>communities of practice</strong>, <strong>indexicality</strong>,  and <strong>language ideologies</strong> can be used  to better understand the ways in which <strong>language</strong> and <strong>gender </strong>intersect and interact.</p>
<p>Remember, words that are <strong>bolded</strong> may appear in quizzes or exams!</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Focus points</h2>
<p>As you read, pay special attention to the following themes,  concepts and theories.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The difference between <strong>sex</strong> and <strong>gender.</strong></li>
  <li>The <strong>Four  Characteristics </strong>of gender</li>
  <li>The concept of <strong>markedness</strong> in grammar.</li>
  <li><strong>Janet  Hyde&rsquo;s</strong> analysis of gender-variability in male and female  communicative behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Don  Kulick&rsquo;s </strong>analysis of <strong>female and  male speech patterns</strong> and their associated <strong>language ideologies </strong>(WARNING: this chapter contains foul language). </li>
  <li>Other <strong>cross-cultural  examples</strong> of gendered differences in speech.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bullet">The Difference Between Gender and Sex</h2>
<p>The easiest way to conceptualize the difference between <strong>gender</strong> and <strong>sex</strong> is that <strong>sex </strong>corresponds  to the biological existence of <strong>female</strong>, <strong>male</strong>, or <strong>ambiguous genitalia</strong> and that <strong>gender</strong> refers to a person&rsquo;s <strong>cultural</strong> or <strong>social identity</strong> as either a <strong>man</strong> or a <strong>woman</strong> (or, in some societies, a <strong>third gender</strong>). Ahearn points out, however, that even our drive to  classify sex as either female or male is driven by a culturally constructed <strong>dichotomous gender ideology</strong>. This need  to assign people to <strong>either </strong>male or  female sex is exemplified by the fact that people who are born <strong>inter-sexed</strong> are usually assigned to one  sex or another, often with early surgical intervention. Thus, <strong>both</strong> sex <strong>and</strong> gender are concepts that are influenced by cultural and social  norms and practices.</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Four Characteristics of Gender </h2>
<h3>Gender is Learned</h3>
<p><img src="mod12_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Baby" />Can you tell what gender this baby is?</p>
<p>One of the first questions expecting parents are asked about  their babies is if they know if their child is a boy or a girl. Gender is  something that is socialized from birth. Girls tend to be dressed in pink&hellip;.</p>
<p><img src="mod12_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Baby" /></p>
<p>Whereas boys are often dressed in blue.</p>
<p><img src="mod12_clip_image006.jpg" alt="Baby" /></p>
<p>However, other than their physiological sex, there is  nothing about a baby that marks it as inherently male or female. From the very  beginning, parents &ndash;consciously and unconsciously&mdash;are engaged in a process of  &ldquo;gendering&rdquo; their child: teaching him or her from birth the appropriate  behavior associated with his or her sex. Recently, news about parents in <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20232/20090623/">Sweden</a> and <a href="http://www.parentdish.com/2011/05/26/genderless-baby/?icid=main%7Chp-laptop%7Cdl1%7Csec1_lnk3%7C214338">Canada</a> who decided not to disclose their babies&rsquo; gender sparked controversy; gender is  an intricate part of our identity, something we might have a difficult time  imagining ourselves without. However, the sets of behaviors that are associated  with being male, female, or (in some cultures) a third gender is <strong>learned</strong>: this is why what is considered  feminine behavior in one place is associated with men in another (see, for  instance, <strong>Kulick&rsquo;s example of  aggressiveness as female characteristics in Samoa</strong>).</p>
<h3>Gender is Collaborative</h3>
<p>Gender, like other aspects of identity like race and  ethnicity, is a <strong>joint accomplishment</strong>.  It isn&rsquo;t something that is constructed by one person or social group and then  imposed on society: gender is constructed in and through <strong>interactions </strong>between members of society.</p>
<p>Look at the image displayed below.</p>
<p><img src="1950sMom.jpg" alt="1950s mom" class="flt inline"/></p>
<p>This  is a classic representation of domesticity in the 1950s. What kinds of  ideologies, values, and ideas about gender are conveyed by this image? In what  ways do you think these ideas were the result of both <strong>male </strong>and <strong>female</strong> beliefs  about the roles of men and women in society?</p>
<p>If  gender is <strong>collaboratively constructed</strong>,  that also means that in many ways, gender and <strong>&ldquo;gender ideologies&rdquo; </strong>are in a process of constant change.</p>

<h3 class="clearl">Gender is Performative</h3>
<p>Gender is something we <strong>do</strong>,  not something we <strong>have. </strong>In Module 8,  we learned about Judith Butler&rsquo;s use of performativity to think about gender as  an identity that is continuously reinforced and reconstructed. This idea is  particularly fruitful if we think about gender as collaborative and learned: if  we <strong>learn how to &ldquo;be&rdquo;</strong> male or female,  and we also take an active role in <strong>defining</strong> what it means to be male or female through <strong>our  social interactions</strong>, it stands to reason that we make <strong>choices </strong>about how we dress, speak, and act &ndash;even if those choices  are <strong>constrained </strong>by what we&rsquo;ve <strong>learned </strong>through our social <strong>interactions</strong>.</p>
<p>These first three characteristics of gender allow for a  great degree of <strong>flexibility</strong> in how  gender is constructed. However, this flexibility is constrained and in many  ways defined by the fourth characteristic of gender: <strong>power asymmetries</strong> are embedded within it. </p>
<h3>Gender Involves Asymmetry</h3>
<p><strong>Inequality is built  into gender</strong>. Even in societies where gender equality is valued, very often  these expressed beliefs do not translate into gender equality in terms of pay,  work opportunities, or societal expectations (for example, in the United States  women still earn on average 30% less than men). Moreover, there are multiple  femininities and masculinities within a single culture and generation --maybe your ideas about what a &ldquo;real man&rdquo; is  like differ substantially from those of your grandfather; likewise, the  expectations of an average UCF female student about her career, when and  whether she would like to marry, and when and whether she wants to have  children some day are possibly quite different from the expectations that a  young Amish woman might have about those very same issues. </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Do men and women talk differently?</h2>
<p>There is a veritable industry out there built on the idea  that conflicts between men and women boil down to differences in communication  styles. This truism is part of our own popular culture and has made into books,  movies, and <a href="http://youtu.be/mxk963cNLvo">stand-up comedy</a>.</p>
<p>Take some time and carefully read pages 195-207. Then, read  the selection from Deborah Cameron&rsquo;s book. In what ways are differences between  male and female speech a part of American cultural <strong>language ideologies</strong> about gender and language rather than any kind  of social reality?</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Gendered Language: Cross-Cultural Examples</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, men and women really <strong>do</strong> speak differently in many cultures. Below are some examples of  cross-cultural differences in male and female speech. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Madagascar:  women are thought to be direct and confrontational in their speech, men are  thought to be indirect and discrete.</li>
  <li>Papua  New Guinea: women engage in <em>kros</em>, an angry, obscene shouting match,  because they are less capable of controlling their <em>hed</em> than men. Men are  taught to suppress and conceal their anger.</li>
  <li>Japanese  &ldquo;women&rsquo;s speech&rdquo; is not readily learned, used, or recognized by Japanese women  in everyday speech, though it remains a feminine ideal (<strong><em>indexical inversion</em></strong>: the social construction of women&rsquo;s  speech actively constructs the active reality that it claims to be  representing).</li>
