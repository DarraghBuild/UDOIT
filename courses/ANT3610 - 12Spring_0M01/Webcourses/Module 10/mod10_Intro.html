<h1>Module 10: Language and Gender</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this module, we will learn about the <strong>social construction</strong> <strong>of  gender</strong> and its connection with both actual linguistic behaviors and social  stereotypes and misconceptions about these behaviors.&nbsp; Have you ever heard people say things like  &ldquo;women are more talkative than men&rdquo;? This is an extremely prevalent stereotype  about the differences in male and female speech in the United States. This  chapter centers around the question, &ldquo;do men and women speak differently?&rdquo; The  answer is actually quite complex: male and female speech patterns <strong>are </strong>quite different from one another in <strong>some contexts</strong>. Moreover <strong>how</strong> these patterns differ varies from  place to place and culture to culture. In other words, although men and women  can have different speech patterns, these differences are <strong>socially constructed </strong>because <strong>gender</strong> is itself <strong>socially constructed</strong>. </p>
<p>This week is another reading-intensive week. Don&rsquo;t feel  overwhelmed though &ndash;two of these readings, the book chapter from Deborah  Cameron&rsquo;s book <em>The Myth of Mars and Venus </em>and Maltz &amp; Borker&rsquo;s &ldquo;cultural  approaches to male-female miscommunication&rdquo; are written for broad audiences and  should make for quick reads. I strongly suggest you read the assigned readings  in <strong>the order in which they are listed</strong>,  however, as Kulick&rsquo;s peer-reviewed book chapter, &ldquo;Anger, gender, language shift  and the politics of revelation in a Papua New Guinean village&rdquo; will be <strong>an important component of this week&rsquo;s f2f  class</strong>. Please note that some of the language in Kulick&rsquo;s article may be  offensive to some. Bear in mind that this language is not gratuitous but  central to the linguistic analysis.</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define sex and gender.</li>
  <li>Explain the difference between sex and gender from the perspective of       anthropology.</li>
  <li>List some of the stereotypes regarding male and female       speech patterns in the United States.</li>
  <li>Explain the relationship between language ideologies       and how these might affect the social construction of gender. </li>
  <li>Analyze the relevance of Kulick&rsquo;s example of female       speech patterns in Papua New Guinea to the study of language and gender.</li>
</ul>
