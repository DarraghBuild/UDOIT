<h1>Module 2&mdash;Assignment</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
<p>This week,  we&rsquo;ve learned about research methods in linguistic anthropology. In order to  demonstrate your understanding of the kinds of research that linguistic  anthropologists engage in, you will first formulate a research question that  you think a linguistic anthropologist might ask. Then, you will demonstrate  your understanding of linguistic anthropological research methods by proposing  a possible research methodology to answer another student&rsquo;s question. </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Instructions</h2>
<h3>For Wednesday</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Write a well-thought out research question. In a separate paragraph,  use information from chapters 1 and 2 of our textbook to explain how you  formulated your research question and why you think a linguistic anthropologist  might ask it. </li>
</ul>
<h3>For Friday</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pick a research question posed by another student and suggest a  research methodology that might help him/her answer it. In a separate  paragraph, explain why this is the best research methodology to answer this  particular question. </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bullet">Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Every student must have no more than <strong>ONE</strong> response to their research question. If choose a question and       someone has already proposed a methodology, you must find someone else to       respond to. </li>
  <li>Please be sure to respect our       netiquette and write clearly, concisely, and correctly. </li>
  <li>You will find an example of a good       research question and reply in the discussion board. </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bullet">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>Next week, we will be learning about language acquisition. In  our f2f class, we will be watching the film &ldquo;<cite class="normal">Acquiring the Human Language:  Playing the Language Game</cite>&rdquo; (P106.H85 1995). </p>
