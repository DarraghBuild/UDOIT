<h1 align="center">Module 2: The Research Process in  Linguistic Anthropology</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
<p>Last week, I discussed  the ways in which linguistic anthropologists understand and conceptualize  language as deeply intertwined with social life. We learned about how  linguistic anthropology differs from linguistics. Finally, I introduced four  key concepts that will guide our understanding of course material from now  until the end of the term. This week, we will look at the &ldquo;nuts and bolts&rdquo;  aspect of linguistic anthropology: how linguistic anthropologists design their  research methodologies and gather and analyze their data. In our f2f  (face-to-face) meeting, we will address any questions you might have thus far  about the course and course materials, and watch the film &ldquo;A World of Gestures&rdquo;  that considers nonverbal communication around the world. </p>
<h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
<p>After completing this module, the student will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the linguistic anthropological research       process. </li>
  <li>Outline the most commonly used research and analytical       methodologies in linguistic anthropology. </li>
  <li>Identify the ethical challenges faced by linguistic       anthropologists and explain how these are addressed. </li>
  <li>Formulate and analyze a research question.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bullet">Time Management</h2>
<p>This course is designed to maximize benefits gained from our  weekly f2f meeting. In order for our class meeting to enhance and further  deepen your understanding of course materials and help you achieve our module  objectives, I suggest you manage your time wisely. An efficient example of how  you can best utilize your time for this course is as follows:</p>
