<h1>Module 8: Performance,  Performativity, and the Constitution of Communities</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Before you read</h2>
<p>Much of what  we do in our everyday lives involves some form of <strong>performance</strong> or <strong>performativity</strong>.  In many ways, this module is about how we <strong>do </strong>things with language. At the outset of chapter 8, Ahearn presents with  three ethnographic examples of phenomena that can be studied using the concepts  of performance and performativity: </p>

<ol>
<li>a normal,  everyday conversation can be studied for dysfluencies, repetitions, and false  starts (like, umm, etc).</li>

<li>A wedding  ceremony in and of itself is a performative event. It takes on even more  significance under circumstances such as when octogenarians Phyllis Lion and  Del Martin got married in the <a href="http://youtu.be/8HksGMTXRxA">first same-sex wedding</a> to take place after the  California Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in 2008. </li>

<li>The  creation of a Spanish-language version of <a href="http://youtu.be/Baf7nmYaTDw">&ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner&rdquo;</a> from which controversies emerged over issues  relating to language and national identity. </li>
</ol>

<p>In this  module, we will be learning about different ways in which linguists and  linguistic anthropologists theorize performance. We will revisit <strong>Chomsky, </strong>and learn about the very important work of <strong>J.L. Austin</strong> and <strong>Judith  Butler</strong>, who posit that we <strong>do</strong> things with words. Finally, the module considers performance as a display of  verbal artistry, introducing the work of <strong>Bauman</strong> and <strong>Briggs</strong>. The peer-reviewed  article I&rsquo;ve assigned for this week by Brenda Farnell considers the performance  of <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/30028824">Nakota Storytelling</a>. The article is challenging  but quite interesting, so be sure plan your time carefully.  </p>

<p>Remember,  anything that is <strong>bolded</strong> is likely to  appear in exams and quizzes and should be present in your graded discussions. </p>

<h2 class="bullet">Focus points</h2>
<p>As you read, pay special attention to these focus points.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chomsky&rsquo;s</strong> definition  of <strong>performance </strong>in opposition to <strong>competence.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Dell Hymes&rsquo;</strong> further  work on <strong>communicative performance.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>J.L. Austin </strong>and his work on <strong>performativity.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Judith  Buttler&rsquo;s </strong>ideas about <strong>gender </strong>as <strong>performative.</strong></li>
  <li>Performance as <strong>display  of verbal artistry</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bullet">Performance defined in opposition to competence</h2>

<p>For <strong>Chomsky</strong>, <strong>competence </strong>refers to the <strong>abstract</strong> and usually <strong>unconscious</strong> knowledge that one has  about the rules of language, and <strong>performance</strong> refers to &ldquo;the <strong>actual use of language in  concrete situations</strong>.&rdquo; As you may remember from module 1, Chomsky&rsquo;s primary  interest lies in the abstract and universal aspects of language use rather than  in how language is used every day. In this course, when we talk about  performance in opposition to competence, this simply means <strong>the everyday use of language in real situations</strong>. In other words, in  this particular viewpoint, anytime you <strong>use </strong>language, you are engaging in <strong>performance</strong>.</p>

<p>  Others, building on Chomsky&rsquo;s work, have tried to explore  what Chomsky calls <strong>performance </strong>or <strong>E-language</strong> (E standing for external).  Famous linguistic anthropologist <strong>Dell  Hymes </strong>argued that true competence also required a <strong>competency for use</strong>: specific and usually unconscious knowledge that  one has to have in order to <em>use</em> language in the real world. </p>

<h2 class="bullet">Performativity</h2>
<p>J.L. Austin&rsquo;s book, <em>How  to do things with words</em> was a game changer when it was first published in  1962. In it, Austin begins by differentiating sentences that mere <em>say </em>something (<strong>constantives</strong>) from sentences that <em>do </em>something (<strong>performatives</strong>). </p>

<p>  For example:</p>

<dl class="inline normal"><dt>  <strong>Constantive: </strong></dt><dd>&ldquo;It  is raining outside.&rdquo; Simple statement of fact.</dd>

<dt>  <strong>Performative</strong>: </dt><dd>&ldquo;I  promise to study harder.&rdquo; A statement of action. </dd>
</dl>

<p>  Think, again, of the wedding vows you just saw. Mayor Newsom  is in fact <em>doing </em>something when he  says &ldquo;I now pronounce you spouses for life.&rdquo;  By merely <strong>saying </strong>something, Mayor Newsom is in fact transforming these two persons&rsquo; legal  status. </p>

<p>  <strong>Performative </strong>utterances  can be <strong>felicitous </strong>or <strong>infelicitous</strong> depending on whether they  are uttered at appropriate times. For example, if instead of saying &ldquo;I now  pronounce you spouses for life&rdquo; at a wedding ceremony, Mayor Newsom had made  this utterance while giving a commencement speech, this utterance would be <strong>infelicitous </strong>because it would not  actually <strong>do</strong> what it was supposed to  do. </p>

<p>  Austin goes on to divide utterances into three categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Locution</strong> is the simple stating of something (another way of identifying a <strong>constantive</strong> utterance).</li>
  <li><strong>Illocution </strong>is the doing of something by simply stating it (another way of identifying  a <strong>performative </strong>utterance). </li>
  <li><strong>Perlocution </strong>the consequences of stating something &ndash;the long-term effects of whatever  has been uttered.</li>
</ul>

<p>But is there any utterance that doesn&rsquo;t <strong>do something</strong>? This about Jakobson&rsquo;s multifunctionality here. If  every utterance has at least one <strong>function</strong>,  couldn&rsquo;t we argue that all utterances are performative?  Austin responds in the affirmative: &ldquo;every  genuine speech act is both [<strong>locutionary </strong>and <strong>illocutionary</strong>]&rdquo; (Ahearn, p.  165).  </p>

<p>  The work of famous feminist writer <strong>Judith Butler</strong> falls within this intellectual tradition. Butler uses  Austin&rsquo;s insight that to <em>say</em> is to <em>do </em>and transforms it into a claim that to <em>say </em>or<em> do </em>is to<em> be</em>. <strong>Gender</strong>, she concludes, is not something  you <strong>have</strong>, but something you <strong>do</strong>. This will become particularly  relevant in a couple of weeks when we look at the connection between language  and gender.</p>

<h2 class="bullet">Performance as a display of verbal artistry</h2>

<p>At the beginning of this module you watched a video of the  2006 song <em>Nuestro Himno</em>, a  Spanish-language rendition of <em>The Star  Spangled Banner</em>. Unsurprisngly, the song sparked tremendous controversy  about patriotism, language, and national identity. I chose this example for  this module in order to bring to life Ahearn&rsquo;s example. The act of listening to  a song &ndash;especially a song that is a powerful emblem such as <em>The Star Spangled Banner&mdash; </em>is different  than reading about it. Perhaps this particular song provoked an emotional  reaction. Maybe you felt uncomfortable, or you connected emotionally to the  familiar melody even if you didn&rsquo;t understand the words. Maybe you even found  it offensive. The point is that <strong>verbal  artistry </strong>is not meant to be understood intellectually, but rather to  produce a subjective reaction. </p>

<p>  Take a few minutes to read pages 171-174 in your textbook. </p>
<p>
  This <a href="http://youtu.be/sbAWT0peS0o">video</a> is of a  song by Mexican rock band Molotov. Notice that the song engages in different  plays on language itself, including code-switching. Please note that the video  contains material that may be offensive to some. </p>
  
  <p>How is this performance framed? How might this song and  video appeal to a specific community? How might this performance serve to  actually <strong>constitute </strong>or <strong>build</strong> a community? How would you say  this performance exemplifies the linkage of language with cultural practices  and social relations?</p>

<h2 class="bullet">Ethnographies of Performance and Performativity</h2>

<p>Take some time to review Ahearn&rsquo;s examples of studies done  on the topic of performance and performativity before reading Farnell&rsquo;s  article. Write down terms that are unfamiliar to you and questions you might  have about the material. </p>
