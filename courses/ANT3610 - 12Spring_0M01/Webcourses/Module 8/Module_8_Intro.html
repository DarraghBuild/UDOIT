<h1>Module 8: Performance and  Performativity</h1>
<h2 class="bullet">Introduction</h2>
<p>The concept of <strong>performance </strong>is one of the most useful we have in linguistic anthropology. This week, we  will consider three distinct approaches taken by linguistic anthropologists to  the concept of performance: performance defined in <strong>opposition to competence, performativity</strong>,  and performance as <strong>a display of verbal  artistry</strong>. I have also assigned a peer-reviewed journal article for you to  read alongside this chapter. Although the article is fairly challenging (it was  published in a very prestigious journal, <em>Anthropological  Linguistics</em>), it is also really, really interesting &ndash;did you know there was  a fully-developed Plains Indian Sign Language? As you read it, you should think  about the concepts learned in this module as well as the <strong>four key terms </strong>that Ahearn reminds us to always keep in mind (<strong>multifunctionality, practice, language ideologies</strong>, and <strong>indexicality</strong>).  Think about how much of our everyday behavior is performative, and how some of  the phenomena we have studied thus far, like <strong>code-switching, literacy  events</strong>, and aspects of <strong>language  acquisition </strong>might be productively studied in terms of performance.</p>
<h2 class="bullet">Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this module, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Summarize different approaches taken by linguistic       anthropologists to concept of performance and performativity. </li>
  <li>Explain the key differences between performance and performativity,       including which linguist or theorist is associated with each concept.</li>
  <li>Analyze the ethnographic examples presented in the       book, article, and lecture using performance and performativity theory as       analytical tools. </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="bullet">Time Management</h2>
<p>This course is designed to maximize benefits gained from our  weekly f2f meeting. In order for our class meeting to enhance and further  deepen your understanding of course materials and help you achieve our module  objectives, I suggest you manage your time wisely. An efficient example of how  you can best utilize your time for this course is as follows:</p>
